How did you get Mickey Rourke to sign on to the project?,"Brian: Well basically we did it the old fashioned way and went through his agent!

Thomas: I can tell you that (what I heard) once Mickey read the script, he really felt connected to the character and he actually left another project to come and work on ours once we closed the negotiation with his team. So he was compelled to play Kaden so much so that he chose us over someone else!",movies
"So the trailer looks awesome! This is exactly my kind of movie haha.

I'd like to know in what ways you think your film sets itself apart from other crime thrillers? In the same vein, what are some aspects from the filmmaking process of this that you're really proud of?

Thanks!","Brian: This is initially not just a crime drama, it's more of a *drama* that is about family ties and bonds and the choices we as humans make, and on top of that the consequences that go with the choices that we make.

Personally I'm really proud of getting to work with such a fantastic crew and cast, getting the ability to tell as tory like this, and to expand into other genres.

Thomas: I think that what sets it apart and puts it in the upper echelon of films of its nature is how flawed all of the characters are that Brian created. I also think the corner stone of this film is the relationship between Ethan and his sister Mia, and we have a more reluctant antagonist. My favorite aspects of the filmmaking process is [laughs] really self-serving but I absolutely loved getting to change every aspect of myself, from the way that I look to the way that I sound to the way that I move.",movies
"What was the casting process like? How involved were you? Did you write it for these actors? Etc etc
Gratz on the film! Ill try and check it out","Brian:

The casting process was the involvement of a casting director we had. I know that Thomas and I used personal relationships as well to get to some of the cast. Social media. We did everything we could to get to our cast.

In terms of the writing process, I had not written the script with the cast in mind, but the cast that we ended up getting far exceeded my expectations.",movies
Do you keep in touch with the American Pie cast? What is your favorite memory from each of the four movies?,"Thomas: During the filming of *Adverse* we had the same production design team that was also working on the *Lethal Weapon* TV show, so I had to do a pickup of some materials at the Warner Brothers lot, and I asked how it was going on the show and if Seann was working that day. They said he was so I decided to surprise him and I waited at video village until he was done with a scene, and he came around the corner and in pure Stifler fashion said

"This isn’t y’all’s first collaboration, counting at least The Lost Tree and Living Among Us.

Is this happenstance from hanging in the same circles with the same fellow creators, or do you two work somewhat as a pair, shepherding new projects together in conscious collaboration?

And after working together on multiple projects, does it make the job harder or easier? Are you more comfortable? Does the comfort help or do nerves and a need to prove yourself and thus push yourself lead to better work?

Lastly, what is the difference, if any, between revenge and justice?

Thanks for taking the time to hang out with us!","Brian: Obviously it is very common to collaborate with a lot of the same people. Thomas is the only person I'm recollaborating with in this film. Andrew Keegan was in the last film. When you have a comfort level and you gel well together, you tend to want to work together again. One rule that Tom and I both have is we don't want to have him play the same character over and over again. It has to be different, and it has to be something that hasn't been done before.

Thomas: I would say we definitely enjoy collaborating; as far as making it harder or easier, I believe we've developed a shorthand over the years of communication. We are constantly pushing ourselves to be better and I think that each project we have done, we have improved - so I'm the most proud of this recent one. It's a collaboration where it's not a guaranteed collaboration, similar to this film when Brian showed me the script and I wanted to play Ethan and he didn't think right away that I was gonna be able to pull it off, so I had to earn my stripes in pre-production, but that's one of the ways that we have pushed each other to achieve better results.",movies
What is your go to cheat meal?,ALL OF THEM.,movies
"Thomas: over your career, have there been any film projects that *almost* happened or an acting parts you *almost* got that you still think about?","Thomas: YES. More than I can count. But the highlights - or I should say lowlights - for me would be screen-testing for *The Good Son* opposite Elijah Wood; however, if I had gotten that role, then I wouldn't have been able to do *Rookie of the Year*.",movies
"When and how did you guys meet, and what was it that inspired you both to work with each other?","Thomas: We initially met in the early 2000s - 2002. Brian came and worked on my directorial debut as a favor to my brother, and he helped with the storyboards and some visual effects work and a couple years later I returned the favor and worked on a project with Brian, and basically we've been working together ever since.",movies
"Hello Brian, Mi here. 
What inspired the storyline to Adverse?","Brian: The storyline was inspired from a real situation from an ex-girlfriend who had gotten caught up with the wrong crowd and she herself became a drug addict, and eventually we had to part ways.",movies
What was your favorite part in making the movie?,"Thomas: My favorite part was and always will be the filming process. I love being on set and this film was no different for me.

Brian: My favorite part in making the movie was probably during the editing phase because you get to see all the footage that you're working with and all the great performances that were involved.",movies
Is Rookie of the year inspiration to you?,"Thomas: I think the inspiration for me is how many people have enjoyed that film, how they've showed it to their kids and their kids have enjoyed that film - including my own kids have enjoyed that film! and that is inspiring to be a part of a project that can entertain so many people.",movies

"If you’ve watched the doc on Spielberg on HBO, you’ll see that many of his movies center around events from his childhood, so this could be very good/classic Spielberg.","Yeah, if I recall correctly, his parents divorced when he was young and getting little information from his parents, he resented his father for the separation. Which is why his films usually feature a breaking down family unit. It wasn't until later he learned the facts were that his mother left his father for the father's best friend.",movies
"Real talk, I think this could be incredible.  Spielberg is honestly the director who has the most clear source for all of his tropes:                     
- Absent father figures - his own father.                        
- WWII and American history - hearing stories of his own father's experience in the war and aspiring to the greatness of that ""greatest generation""                         
- Childhood innocence - He grew up during the Hollywood golden era when pictures had ""standards"" and everything had to be squeaky clean. When Spielberg came of age, he led the ""New Hollywood"" movement along with Coppola, De Palma, and others.  Spielberg's own films focused on trying to recapture the whimsy of the films he grew up watching, usually with a modern twist (the violence of Indiana Jones). He explored the themes he loved as a child through the eyes of an adult.                           
- A love for Hollywood - This works off the previous point, but obviously, his desire to make movies and tell stories was a result of some famous Hollywood directors being seen as father figures in his life. They were often brief encounters, there is a famous story about him sneaking into John Ford's office and asking Mr. Ford how to make a great movie. Ford told a young Spielberg:                      
*""When you can come to the conclusion that putting the horizon on the bottom of the frame or the top of the frame is a lot better than putting the horizon in the middle of the frame, then you may someday make a good picture-maker. Now get out of here!”*                      
After Spielberg found fame through Jaws, he snuck onto the set of Alfred Hitchcock's last film Family Plot. Hitchcock was an idol of Spielberg's and Steven thought that with his newfound fame he could finally meet the master he adored.                             
Not the case.                
Hitch had him banned from the set and refused to meet him.             
When people would ask Hitchcock ""Why not just talk to him, at least once."" he would reply, ""Oh, the boy who did the fish movie?.. No, I won't see him - I feel like such a whore.""                                   
Hitchcock's explanation was that he felt embarrassed because he was the voice of the Jaws ride at Universal Studios, he felt like he had sold out. I think in reality, Hitchcock knew that he could never match up to Spielberg's vision of what he thought he was like - he would prefer his successor still see him as something cinematic and not real - like cinema itself.  Hitchcock would remain more powerful in Spielberg's memory that way, more influential that way.                         
Spielberg says one of the most important moments of his life was David Lean giving him a live commentary during a private screening of Lawrence of Arabia. They became good friends until funding fell through on a picture Spielberg was helping Lean make.           
Lean never spoke to Spielberg again.                                 
                                
So yeah, I could see this being an incredible look at how a kid looks to films and their directors as his true father figures and guidance in life.","The director part reminds me how close he was able to get to Kubrick too, who was known for just sort of, keeping to himself and his family+crew.",movies

"My humble review: 

If superhero movies are like rides in an amusement park, some movies like Sam Raimi's Spider Man 2, Avengers Endgame and Guardians of the Galaxy are like the rides that you go expecting to be good and they are even better. When it is ending you already want to go again so you ignore every other ride and stay in line for hours, all day, to go again in this particular ride. Every time you go on this ride you feel te same emotion, somewhat diminished by the fact that you know everything already. At the end of the day you take a picture in front of the ride to remember forever.

Movies like Daredevil, Thor The Dark World, Batman and Robin and Shazam are like the rides that you go once just to tell that you went and usually don't ride again, except if you think that there's nothing better to do. You wonder if you would like it better if you were younger or if you never went in any ride before.

Movies like WW84, BVS:DOJ and sNyDeR cUt are like the rides that you didn't really wanted to go, you just ate all the hotdogs and are feeling very full, but that guy that went with you that you don't even like is calling and saying that if you don't go some stranger will have to sit with your group. So you go and you feel sick in the middle of the ride, vomiting all over yourself and on some strangers feet. You wait for the ride to end and run for the bathroom to clean yourself. After a while a picture of you covered in vomit shows up and you get a fun new nickname.","You lost me when you put Shazam on Batman & Robin level.

Hoover shouldn't be hailed as a hero, his legacy should be tarnished and his actions condemned by all.

“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump then you ain’t black” (to a black person)


“You got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that’s a storybook, man.” (That’s in reference to President Obama.)


“Unlike the African-American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly diverse attitudes about different things.”

The resolution on both of these is pretty low, so I would actually recommend getting the DVD because while the movie is abundantly cheesy, it doesn't take itself too seriously and can enjoyed unironically.

Despite being mid-budget, the production design and special effects are surprisingly good.

No, it’s not a great film by writing or editing standards, and Excalibur is miles ahead of it, but LotS delivered a memorable experience for me considering it was able to blend Guy Ritchie’s engaging and frankly captivating filmmaking style with the fantasy genre, a bold task that could’ve blown up in the film’s face, but I found it mostly refreshing if only a tinge run-of-the-mill in regards to character. Again, it’s not perfect and maybe not even great, but it’s a movie that’s special to me and I truly might be its number one fan in the world lmao.","I know that movie flopped, but man I loved it.  Great sound track too.",movies
"Conan the Barbarian, Willow, Ladyhawke and the LoTR trilogy were great. And although I truly enjoy sword and sorcery movies in general, a lot of the others aren't exactly great but I did thoroughly enjoy them (Legend, Clash of the Titans - old and new, Red Sonja, Kull, Beastmaster, etc.) In the last decade, these are the ones I've enjoyed (though not necessarily great):

* Conan the Barbarian (2011)
* Hobbit Trilogy (2012-2014)
* Seventh Son (2014)
* Warcraft (2016)
* The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016)

But, it's not a hill I'm going to die on.",movies
"I agree. It's a shame that we get so many great sci-fi movies (BladeRunner 2049, Arrival, Ex-machina, etc), but we don't get great magical fantasy movies.  

LoTR is the peak of a very lonely mountain.  We got the Hobbit films which weren't nearly as good. There was a Dungeons and Dragons movie like 20 years ago which was mediocre. There was Eragon and Golden Compass which both screwed up. They're making another D&D movie which I have no faith in.  Oh and of course Harry Potter.

Live Action aside, we occasional get animated movies with minimal amounts of magic (Brave, Tangled, Princess and the Frog, etc).  There's the Shrek franchise which has a fair amount of magic but they made sure to beat that dead horse. And finally there's Onward which I thought was great. 

Movies aside, if you want good, live-action magic (albeit without swords), I highly recommend watching The Magicians. The first 3 seasons are great (getting better and better with each one). And it's a solid series overall. And also watch Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. And if you haven't seen it, go watch the Sam Neill Merlin miniseries (which is like 20 years old). 

TL:DR: Good magic but not really swords (movies and shows)

* LoTR
* Onward
* Harry Potter
* Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell
* Merlin (1998 starring Sam Neill)
* The Magicians
* Game of Thrones (ninja edit)

Eddie's problem is that he peaked too early.  Everything from 1990 has failed in comparison to his hot start, but even then he's still been starring in theatrical releases for 40 years.    And there have been gems along the way such as Nutty Professor, Life, Shrek, Bowfinger, Dreamgirls Dolemite, that still showcased his talent.

But then as I was going through high school he started shoveling out so much crap like Daddy Day Care and The Haunted Mansion.  Once we rented Norbit I was done.  

Didn't watch any of his stuff until Tower Heist 'cause of the good buzz I heard online.  And I really liked it.

People are shredding Coming 2 America but I thought it was fine for a sequel coming out 33 years later.

I Care a Lot doesn't give any of the characters any of that.

"I 100% agree that Marla Grayson was an unredeemable and unlikeable character, though part of me wonders if people's hate for her is exacerbated because she is a woman. 


Hear me out- there's been a known problem with some modern media of fandoms rooting for male protagonists who the creators have written to be bad people- Rick Sanchez, Bojack Horseman, Walter White. Then by contrast, some of those same fandoms hate the women that conflict with those men, even if they aren't nearly as morally reprehensible: Skylar White, Diane Nyguen, etc. It's the whole Joe Exotic vs Carol Baskins, Trump vs Hilary thing- a charismatic but heinous man being more favorable to a ""shrill"" woman in our society. But then when the charismatic but heinous man becomes a woman? There's suddenly none of that ill-placed sympathy.


I'm not saying that Marla Grayson is disliked for bad reasons, as a woman I did hate her character, but part of me wonders if people would have hated the character so much if Marla was a male con artist scamming the elderly.","Not disagreeing that that shit doesn't happen, but Grayson is introduced as a horrible person and she stays horrible.

Walt White is absolutely a good guy driven to a bad place in Breaking Bad's earlier seasons. He is doing it for medical bills and to look after his family.

Rick and Bojack are introduced and party loving nihilists before the darker themes were explored.

Grayson is introduced as a horrible person and is irredeemable from the outset. When she is in too deep, we don't see her hit a low point. Instead she says she always gets what she wants. We don't see her doing anything particularly fun with her wealth like live an insane hedonistic lifestyle like Belafont or Sanchez and she is never funny. She just seems to enrich her close circle of 'friends' who she doesn't seem that friendly with. The only time they try to make her relatable is the fact she has a girlfriend, who would presumably be sad if she died.",movies

"The movie missed out on making the case for Marla by including scenes of her being poor and oppressed prior to becoming a villain, but that would’ve been too much like many recent films. Either way, it doesn’t celebrate awful people any more than Joker or The Irishman did.

Personally I find the movie a little too plastic for my liking. It’s like a low rent spin on Promising Young Woman by the same preachy feminists who complained about its ending. Though it’s hilarious to watch the hypocrisy from the same people who loved Joker.","for most movies that follow a criminal doing crimes, often they are not doing something that we see is directly hurting people, like producing/selling drugs or robbing a casino, etc. Or if they are directly hurting others, it is other criminals, like in Goodfellas/Casino/Irishmen. 

In Marla's case, she's effectively kidnapping elderly people and draining them of all their money until they die. And she knows what she's doing. She's methodical, cold and ruthless. It's almost the worst type of person you could make a protagonist, which means then you have to work overtime in making them endearing in others way. I Car A Lot does nothing to address this, so we are actively rooting for Marla's demise very early on. They try to counter this with Roman, and having him be a human trafficker somehow will make us root for Marla to beat him, but I don't think it worked.

"My recommendation to watching LOTR you should watch the extended editions. They add more context to where it makes a lot of things make more sense.

There may be somethings you don't understand right away, as it might just be in the extended lore of the books but otherwise you just might love it!

Why is it biased that the largest group of Black film critics wanted to award this film?

“Serving alongside an all-Black producing team, Judas and the Black Messiah director Shaka King created a project that permanently enshrines pivotal Black Panther leader Fred Hampton as an American hero,” commented AAFCA President and co-founder Gil Robertson. “Released against the backdrop of the present-day Black Lives Matter movement, the film’s message of commitment and sacrifice to social justice is empowering. Daniel Kaluuya as Hampton is literally on fire and is supported well by Dominique Fishback who increasingly has become an actress to watch. Our members are thrilled to award the film with our highest honor.”",movies

On Amazon products, you can see which reviews are from a 'verified purchaser', but IMO the non-verified ones just shouldn't be there, because otherwise every product's financiers are incentivised to negatively review all competing products.

"The BAFTA nominations were on crack and I love it- too often has it just been Oscars-lite. Special mention to the Director nominations for including Another Round, Babyteeth, Quo Vadis Aida and Rocks- films that would defo not be nominated for best director at the Oscars. (Though I wish the best film category was a bit more inspired, The Mauritanian the only surprise. Would have liked Rocks there but oh well)

Also due to the chaotic nature of the nominations, I don't think Carey Mulligan would be too affected by the snub, still think she's the one to beat for best actress.

The BAFTAs might risk being irrelevant but it's become a lot more cooler now","The thing is, I kinda glad Alfre Woodward got the nom for Clemency.",movies
"Honestly it seems like their new system overdid it, it's funny that the categories that don't use it kind of contradict the ones who do, to me they overcompensated it with the diversity to the point it looks like they tried to go for diversity more than anything else.",Maybe so but its still varied enough and different from the predictable noms,movies
"Best sound for Nomadland is bullshit. What on earth did it have that elevated the material/make it stand out?? I still love the movie, and I wouldn’t be that mad if it won Best film, but there were other movies that deserved it more.

No nomination for Fincher and Oldman is odd too",I wonder if it had anything to do with the team member who passed?  (not to sound callous),movies

I don’t mean that as a knock on her, and although I have yet to see the film, I have heard wonderful things about her performance. Just confused how her performance in Clemency can still be in the running when it came out two years ago, and I haven’t seen anyone else talk about it.","UK release date was later (seven months later), it fell into this year's releases in the UK.",movies
"Hilarious tbh. Just vote for whoever you think did the best job, it's not hard. Gender/Race should have nothing to do with it. You can't tell me that some of these people weren't just chosen so the nominations would appear more diverse this year.

Without the backlash in previous years Carey Mulligan would have been nominated no questions asked. Deservedly so.","You're acting like there isn't always a few bunk nominations every single year.

"It does seem weird to remove him.

Sure, he's 'problematic' if he was just up to his old hijinks and it was played for laughs, but as I understand it, the entire point of his scene was for Lebron to actually talk to him about the importance of consent.

Seems more beneficial to address how terrible he's being than to just pretend he doesn't exist. But someone on Twitter got it right when they said (paraphrased slightly): 

>>It's interesting that rather than address Pepe Le Pew's conduct, they'd rather just not show it and pretend it's not a problem / doesn't happen, because that's what happens in Hollywood generally.",turns out they removed him for legal reasons- Harvey Weinstein wasn't happy about not receiving the rights for an unauthorised cartoon portrayal of him,movies

This is much more of a world and experience-driven movie than a character and narrative driven one, and it excels at that, and I can’t sit for what’s to come from this franchise, even though part of me didn’t think it needed a sequel, but the possibilities for the world, even starring wholly other character and concepts would be wondrous.",Yeah!

"It was definitely a marker for its time, to be sure. I'm sure Cameron has some insanely ambitious things to do for the sequels. Frankly, I think the time for those has come and gone, and there will be little interest in comparison to the first film.

Realistically, the movie itself is pretty piss-poor. It's always been mocked for being a ripoff of about a half dozen other movies, and the real marvel about it was always the CGI and the 3D. It's not like Avatar was panned or anything, but it's not like it was ever one of those films that anyone talked about being a standout film that would become a classic years later. It's an average film with above-average effects.

The sequels are taking too long to arrive. We're already 12 years removed from Avatar's release, with no actual sign of when the next films are coming. I think they will severely under perform at the box office if and when they're released.","Avatar 2 is the most anticipated movie in China and it’s still years out.

One of my favourite movies that I watched this year. The relationship between the grandma and the boy is especially beautifully written and acted. Alan Kim is adorable and Youn Yuh-Jung deserves the Oscar.,"Does anyone why Nomadland is such a landslide favorite to win best picture? I honestly thought Minari was better. 

I still liked Nomadland, but I don’t know. The way it’s sweeping the award season, you’d think it was a weak year with no other competition, but to me, Minari and Sound of Metal are at the very least on par with it. And they were sort of similar too, touching on the same emotional veins, all had a similar meditative feel, all indie-style movies. You would think they would be splitting the vote.",movies
It was fun not knowing we’re the movie was going to go. The family unit was a wonderful one. The National division of nationalities are made painfully obvious. We need to work harder for unity.,"Hm where is the national divisions shown? I think rural America (the church, Paul, etc) was pretty receptive to the family (but I think that's detached from reality)",movies

Never understood how this movie became such a huge hit. The 3D was ok but the story was bland and forgettable.

It's a simple story where a tribe fights a colonial power and wins, that's gonna play well in most parts of the globe.",movies
James Cameron is just being petty. He can't stand his movie not being the highest grossing of all time so he has to release Avatar again. He had to rerelease it 3 times just to get it that high in the first place,"And avengers endgame had to release it twice to beat avatar while avatar was already number 1. 

It seems like endgame was the first to do it to get the number 1 title. 

Btw both are owned by Disney. James doesn’t get to decide if it releases or not.",movies
Some of that was deliberate. It was through Kingsman 2 and meeting Elton John on set that I believe Egerton got involved with Rocket Man. I can't explain Sing 2016 though.,I'm guessing he was hired for Rocket Man because of Sing.,movies
"And he kills it every time. I love Egerton, and I'm excited to see what's coming next. I know he's making *Tetris*, which is about the legal battles over the game. I do love playing Tetris, but I know nothing about the story there, so I wonder how engaging it will be.

I love James Cameron, he's obviously directed some of my favorite movies over the years, I really wish he would do something else lol",Avatar’s pop culture relevance is people bringing up how it has no pop culture relevance,movies
"Oh FFS, grow up Cameron.  “Boo hoo, something being built up for a decade made more money.” I can’t wait to not watch Avatar 2 in theaters.","Calm down, dumbass. The CFB specifically requested Avatar for re-release last March, along with all 4 Avengers films. It wasn’t a decision made by Cameron or Disney. Due to the second theater lockdown the plan had to be temporarily shelved.",movies
"In the Mouth of Madness (1994), Directed by John Carpenter. Also has one of my favorite actors, Sam Neill. It's a movie I keep going back to occasionally just to rewatch.","Yep.
Its 1 part if the apocalypse trilogy including the Thing and Prince of Darkness",movies
"The Fly - 1986 version. SciFi/Horror that works on intellectual and visceral levels.

Edit: I hope this comment turned many on to this underrated classic, which seems to fly (this being Reddit, pun intended) under the radar for some reason. Without overstating, there are very few movies that tug at so many emotions (heartbreak,   anger, revulsion, fear) in such an effective way. This is one of a handful of movies that I've seen (out of thousands) that immediately spring to mind when the question of ""primal impact,"" good or bad, comes up. E.g. Ikiru (good), Irreversible (which is a whole nother level of horror or ""bad"")

For those who will be watching for the first time: As the tagline goes... Be afraid. Be very afraid.

...and enjoy!

Thanks to OP for rousing such a lively conversation.","Yes!! Cronenberg practically invented the ‘body horror’ sun-genre with this. It’s so tragic - Goldblum and Davis were never better.  I was terrified of it as a kid but still watched it three times because it was just so well done. The pacing is excellent and Goldblum’s arc from triumphant scientist to horrified victim to psychotic is amazing.  

FYI Alien is my favourite horror and I think Aliens and T2 are the best action films ever made.  The Exprcist, The Thing and The Fly are my other favourite horrors.",movies
The Thing is definitely the closest to Alien in atmosphere. Also Predator.,"I personally prefer The Thing. It had great acting, like Alien did, but the terror of the situation was so much harder. I think partially because of how it moved around. The Thing remains my favorite horror movie of all time.",movies
Forbidden Planet with Leslie Nielsen is essential.  You'll see the influence on Alien and other sci-fi movies.,Definitely  it's one of the few pre Star Wars sci-fi movies to still stand up.,movies
The Ritual on Netflix. Go into it blind. Easily one of the greatest creature designs I've seen next to the Xenomorph.,"This movie was sooo much better than I expected. I agree with going in blind, you won't be disappointed.",movies
"The Descent

and yeh i agree, i rewaatched it recently and was amazed with what ridley scott and giger achieved with just greys and blacks, theres so little color in the movie, yet its visually one of the richest movies i have ever seen.

The scenes on the ship are just so full of detail. It also made me deeply appreciate alien isolation game, the way they have incorporated key atmospheric elements of this and aliens is one of the most impressive feats ive seen in a game.","The lighting in The Descent is beyond spectacular. They're in a cave. Caves are naturally dark. 

And yet, the lighting is evocative, you can always tell what is going on, and there is always a *reason* for the light source to be there.

It's a stunning accomplishment.",movies
Jacob’s Ladder (1990),"That movie legitimately feels like watching a nightmare. Disorienting and claustrophobic, an ever present sense of dread with disturbing imagery that sticks with you. All while taking place in what seems like reality but everything’s just a little bit off.",movies
"Here are some Science Fiction Horror Films you might like:

**Altered States, Invasion of The Body Snatchers** (the 1978 version), **The Crazies, Pontypoole, The Signal** (the 2007 film with three different segments/directors), **eXistenZ, Videodrome, The Hidden**,  and for a fun B-movie:  **Saturn 3**.","Invasion of the Body Snatchers has amazing, grounded performances. Same kind of real I thought was in the characters of Alien (which I can't wait to share with my son when he's old enough.)",movies
"Alien is my GOAT horror film as well. Since you've already seen The Thing, I think the closest in style for me was Annihilation. 

The pace and slowly progressing dread is extremely similar to Alien, as is that whole feel of facing an unknown horror. It's a fantastically made film. 

Obviously not quite at Alien's legendary level, but a few big scenes in Annihilation reminded me of what it would've been like to watch the most famous Alien scenes (like the chestburster) without knowing they're coming.",Whoever did the audio for Annihilation should win all the awards there are to give,movies
I really liked Event Horizon,"Laurence Fishburne plays the smartest character in a horror movie too. As soob as he sees the security footage he says they're leaving. ""You can't just leave the ship here!""

""I'm not. I'm going to my ship abd firing as many missiles at it until I'm satisfied that it's vaporized...""",movies
"I have a soft spot for Europa Report. It is pretty light on the horror, but does ""space exploration gone wrong"" well.","It's not exactly horror but it's amazing hard Sci-Fi, excellent film",movies
Check out The Abyss.  Great atmosphere,"WHERE IS MY BLU-RAY OF THE ABYSS AND TRUE LIES, JAMES? WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?!",movies
"If you haven't seen it yet, I think Sunshine is your best bet. It has a lot of that atmosphere.. The space environment isn't retro-futuristic, more pure futuristic.. But the sci fi stuff involved is really good IMO. It is more man against environment than man against alien being, but it is probably the closest to what you seem to be looking for. There really isn't another movie like Alien, and that kind of sucks to be honest. 

I feel the same way about David Cronenberg's best stuff. There just isn't enough of it.","I love Sunshine - it does so much right, from the plot, to the cinematography, to the cast, to the soundtrack, to its overall feel - but I will forever be irritated that the direction they took was having it devolve into a slasher movie 70% of the way through. It’s still good, I still recommend it, but it could’ve been *perfect*.",movies
"If you like the slow-burn horror genre without any gore, I suppose you might like **Rosemary's Baby,** that is, if you haven't seen it already. It's a classic in the genre.

Though, if it's sci-fi/horror you're looking for that's low on gore, it gets a little tricky if you've already seen Alien and the Thing. There's a film called **Galaxy of Terror** that's a trashy, low-budget knock off of Alien, but it has some genuinely memorable scenes, for better or worse, haha.

Someone may have mentioned it already, there's the original **Solaris**. Russian film, more of a cerebral study in grief and regret than horror, but incredibly strange and beautiful.

Though it may be a little gory, the Richard Stanley-directed **The Color Out of Space,** was freaky as all get out. One of the few Lovecraft stories done right!",Rosemary’s baby is an all time great.,movies

Jaws.,"Jaws is my favorite movie of all time.  What other horror movie can say it impacted an entire industry? People still have trouble entering the water because of this movie.  What's also amazing about this movie is the impact the soundtrack has had on pop culture.  I was an elementary school music teacher for many years and I would occasionally bust out a cello and play just two notes a half step away from each other.  No matter how old, children would yell SHARK!  Even 4 year olds who've never seen the movie, of course, would know what those two notes implicated.",movies
"Ravenous is a great freaky movie too. 

And Bone Tomahawk.

But now I thinking more about westerns.","Second for Ravenous, some truly unhinged performances there",movies
"Nobody has brought up The VVitch yet?

You want atmosphere that movie has it","The Witch and also Under The Skin are my fave horrors of recent years.
Both movies are excellent and uniquely original. Both weave an extremely heavy and truly horrifying experience without ever resorting to tropes or gory spectacle.",movies
"I love watching Alien and Blade Runner, I know blade runner isnt a horror film, but damn the atmospheric nature of these two films is something truly amazing to me. I would say Solaris maybe if you havnt checked the original or remake out.",That retro futurism of Alien and  Cyberpunk-esque noir of Blade Runner is top notch. Ridley Scott did an excellent job with the atmosphere of both films.,movies
You should check out Mario Bava's [Planet of the Vampires](http://manapop.com/film/planet-of-the-vampires-1965-review/) as it definitely influenced much of *Alien*.,I second this notion.

I liked Pandorum,"Loved that film. Understand the critics but all the same, fun and scary.",movies
"Not too similar thematically but The Thing and Hereditary have a similar sense of 'I know something is going wrong, but I don't know exactly what or how bad' constant tension and have a sparring but effective use of jumpscares. Plus, they are both just absolutely stellar movies.",Hereditary is my GOAT horror movie but it doesn't have a lot in common with Alien so OP may or may not be into it.,movies
"I'm gunna go ahead and say:

30 Days of Night is a *fantastic* horror movie 

The build up and isolation first 30 minutes sets up is incredible and the rest of the movie plays out as a sort of cat and mouse game between the creatures and the townsfolk. I love it","30 Days of Night kinda falls of the rails at the end.  
I love the whole setup and the start of the cat-and-mouse situation but the last act leading up to the big ""fight"" is a pretty meh way to conclude.",movies

They Live (1988),The cripple fight in South Park... amazing.,movies
"The Haunting, 1963.","Thank you! ! This is what I came on here to post! This is the scariest film ever made as it leaves almost everything to your own imagination. The banging on the walls.... jesus your heart goes crazy!
In fact I think Alien shares many of the elements of this movie: setting scenes with normality, getting to know and care about the characters, lots of silence and minimal music, not really showing anything and instead showing the faces and reactions to the things. Oh it's scary!",movies
"A Dark Song (2016) - A slow burn with an ending that I still think about.

Aniara (2018) - Another slow burn with a nice touch of existential dread.","Hello fellow Dark Song enjoyer. Although Im not convinced its what the OP is after, its still a film I recommend quite frequently to people who like horror films and who may have not have heard of it.

Although its a very different film, it has a similarity to Hereditary in that the ending is very polarising. I personally loved the end of A Dark Song but but I do feel that you have to just go with it to enjoy it most.",movies
Annihilation,From the same director of Ex Machina. Both great sci-fi flix.,movies

Event Horizon,This movie is my favorite sci-fi horror movie.,movies
"I got a kick out of Sunshine (2007), but it's not on the same level by any means.","It wasn't really that far from it though. If the goal is atmosphere and awesome world building, I think Sunshine does a good job of making that journey pretty real and awesome. The end is iffy to be sure, but the lead up is really really good.",movies
Relic is a pretty good creature feature.,Relic is one of my go to monster movies. Have you read the book by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child?,movies
"Predator for the same experience.

The Abyss, but in a VERY different way.

Enemy Mine for something REAL weird.",Enemy Mine is one of the best Sci-Fi Novellas.,movies

Nosferatu (1922)

"If you're into horror movies where the characters feel very real, I have 2 recommendations:

The Thing (1982) by John Carpenter

In that film, the monster takes the shape of the people in the crew, so it places every character against each other. Really shows you the limits of the human psyche.

Climax (2018) by Gaspar Noe

Dance troop is at a practice in a school for a competition. Someone puts LSD in the drinks so everyone becomes crazy. Plus the entire movie is filmed in one shot so it really adds to the realism and how deeply terrible humans are.",I watched Climax on the come-down from an acid trip. It was very intense.

The Abyss (SF),

"Galaxy of Terror, The Keep, The Ninth Configuration.

People will laugh at Galaxy of Terror, but if you ignore it's cheapness, it's really good.","The Keep, if you can find it, is totally worth a watch.  One of my faves growing up, and the Tangerine Dream soundtrack is the bomb...  

The book this movie was based on, ""The Keep"" by F. Paul Wilson, was the first in a series of now 7 books dubbed the ""Adversary Cycle"".

Also Tremors is technically a horror film, although to me it feels more like an adventure movie.

"Tremors is pretty much a perfect movie, a different tone of movie but has a lot of the same benefits, excellent cast and correct application of monster effects.

The main problem you're going to have is Alien will become a boomerang you keep coming back to.

It's definitely an 80s movie, and it's hard to see past it being ""the Schwarz"" as you watch this practically indestructible cyborg kill anyone in its path to achieve its mission, but for its time, it was truly terrifying. He was pretty much an unknown at the time. But when you trace his explosion to fame back, this was film was the moment.

Also, despite the sequels all being these major blockbusters they spent tons of money on, the original has some real grit to it. It feels more realistic.  


And unlike some of Carpenter's other movies being set in completely remote and isolated areas, and this one being set in one of the largest cities on the planet, he really did a good job making it feel still as isolated for the plight of the main character(s)",">And unlike some of Carpenter's other movies being set in completely remote and isolated areas, and this one being set in one of the largest cities on the planet, he really did a good job making it feel still as isolated for the plight of the main character(s)

The technology looks retro now but at the time it looked futuristic. What I liked about the props and production design in this space movie vs space movies that are more recent is that Alien seemed realistic. The interiors are functional and believable. In space cubic space matters, materials, weight, all of it matters. The humans on the Nostromo were given just enough room to exist and do what was needed no more no less. There is a conscious economy of human needs for space navigation. In modern films of space they seem more like extravagant 3d designer explorations of fantasy craft. As if money and materials and construction was of no concern - As long as it looks cool and futurisitc then, yeah lets show it... This is why you have Charlize Theron living in her own deluxe condo suite that is a gigantic living space..in one of the later ALien films..

"The Star Wars sequel trilogy.

It starts off with some great, vivid characters, interesting dynamics, exciting action, polished execution and some genuinely interesting mystery elements. Kylo Ren was the best conceived possible new villain character possible, played by one of the best new actors around. Stormtrooper turned rebel is brilliant. Anonymous scavenger with a mystery connection to the force intriguing. The mythic hero Luke missing, the Knights of Ren, Luke's lightsaber recovered, *every part* of the first two acts of TFA had great, great setup to something genuinely new and exciting.

Then they repeat the Death Star for a third time. Then they kill off the big boss with no explanations given. Then subplots go nowhere. Then kamikaze lightspeed maneuvers capable of destroying a whole fleet. Then...

...somehow, Palpatine returned.

I dislike TLJ already, but Rise of Skywalker felt like one of those shitty 80s B-movie Star Wars rip-offs stapled together from a handful of different scripts that don't go together to earn a quick buck. There's no part in that movie that wasn't outright *stupid* in one way or another, which is a first for me since Batman & Robin, another movie that was made entirely to sell toys.

What's worse is Rogue One is *right fucking there*. Disney can make a great (albeit flawed) Star Wars movie. It hurts.","And the simple solution to making a great new trilogy:

Hire David Filoni. He doesn't even need to direct, but just give advice and plan out the trilogy.",movies

Does World War Z count? The book was amazing; the movie took the same concept and butchered it.,"I mean, they didn't even use the same idea, it was basically an unrelated movie but used the name of the book. If they would have titled the movie Battle: Zombies you would have not picked it out as being the WWZ book.",movies
"I think Premonition is the poster child for this. Highly attention grabbing premise, but what even is this film, honestly?

"The thing that gets me about *Yesterday* is that the entire concept makes no sense. The Beatles came about at a very specific time, and made a very specific type of music when they came out that resonated with a lot of people. That's what made them, and their songs, extremely famous. It's not literally just about the songs themselves. 

Some guy releasing every Beatles song isn't going to gain notoriety in the same way. I understand the overall theme, but it's told in a way that doesn't make any sense. I know I'm trying to put a touch of logic into a fantasy film, but still...it doesn't work.","I had the same exact thought. The most realistic part of the movie is when he is playing ""Let It Be"" in the living room and his parents don't give a damn. 

If you were at some modern party with young friends and started busting out ""Yesterday"" on the acoustic, your friends would politely nod, wait for you to finish, and then continue to blast Cardi B and Ariana Grande on the speakers.",movies

"Stay Alive. 

Fantastic concept which could have been a franchise and a massive IP but the execution killed it.","It had one of the biggest names in the gaming industry as a creative consultant but was completely wrong about both game design - one guy can't make an entire game by himself - and trivia - the guy gives a cheat for fighting the final boss in Silent Hill 4 as dropping all your ammo and the game kills the boss to spare the player from an unwinnable boss fight; you can't drop items in the game, >!losing the boss leads to the worst ending!< and the trick is from the wrong game since it only works in Silent Hill 1.

They clearly wrote the story as having the ghost of Madame Delphine LeLaurie since it's set in New Orleans and she was a vanity-obsessed serial killer, but thought to use another, more infamous historical serial killer instead.

God, that movie really botched things.",movies
I actually like Yesterday... I'm not sure what else they could've done with that concept. It's a fine simple rom-com.,"Concept was fine, the plot was bad.

For me, it does hold the movie back but I still thought it was entertaining and interesting enough to be really good.",movies

I think the Lord of the Rings must be high up the violent family film list too.

">G (general audiences): G ratings are most notable for what the films don’t include: sex and nudity, substance abuse, or realistic/noncartoon violence.
PG (parental guidance): Some material may not be suitable for children. The movie may have mildly strong language and some violence, but no substance use or physical abuse.
PG-13 (parental guidance-13): Some material may not be suitable for children under 13. Any nudity has to be nonsexual, and any swear words have to be used sparingly. Violence in PG-13 films may be intense, but must be bloodless.
R (restricted): No one under 17 admitted without an accompanying parent or guardian. This rating is given for frequent strong language and violence, nudity for sexual purposes, and drug abuse.

There’s not really many choices for movie ratings, and it’s mostly just based on some very simple guidelines regarding violence, sexuality/nudity, and drugs.  It’s a very outdated rating system that definitely needs to be updated and refined for modern standards.","> it’s mostly just based on some very simple guidelines regarding violence, sexuality/nudity, and drugs.

It's not at all, though. It's based on totally arbitrary feelings the MPA has for each movie. Nothing about their ratings have ever been consistent or simple, and they make it notoriously difficult for filmmakers to appeal their ratings. 

Yes, they have some ""rules"" they try to always stick to, such as ""fuck"" is okay once in a PG-13, but not if it's sexual, then it's an automatic R-rating...but even that's not always the case, as they used the word in a sexual context in the Johnny Depp film Secret Window, and that was still PG-13. 

It's completely random.",movies

\- A Clockwork Orange, the closeup of Alex's face with the infamous theme playing at the Korova milk bar.

\- The opening kill in Jaws with the woman screaming in terror before disappearing silently beneath the waves.

\- UP, one of the most emotional relationship montages ever, better than most feature length films.

\- Scream, Drew Barrymore's stabbing and lynching when no one expected her to die.

"Yea most films I have worked on shot digitally have added film grain. There are a lot of reasons for it.

- look and feel
- matching cameras, as your example
- matching exposure, as digital cameras gets more noisy as you raise exposure it could be first added noise removal to the shot and then added grain to make a uniform grain on the film","It can also added to the perception of sharpness, for several reasons:

1. You see bits of ""grain"" in sharp-focus, which adds to the feeling that the frame itself is very sharply focused.
2. The grain gives texture to otherwise smooth sections of the frame: actors' cheeks are often noted for benefitting from the effect: an audience mistakens the grains for seeing the pores on the actor.
3. The grain appears in different, random locations on each frame, so across 24 frames each second, the audience's eyes average more information than is present on any individual frame, even if the shot itself is static. This effect is also partially created in pure digital footage due to the action of the demosaic, but still.",movies

- Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. Another great films about falling in love, moving on, all that stuff, and is also told in such a creative way (my personal pick for favorite Jim Carrey performance) 

- Blue Valentine. A movie that also has to do with falling in love, as well as marriage and just those very complex emotions with it. Has Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, both are really great in it.",Thank you!,movies

The events that happened are so much worse than what was reported on at the time. 

The series also does a good job of highlighting the way he normalizes the older man/much younger woman relationships in his movies (such as Manhattan). Woody is so privileged, he made movies about what a huge pervert he is for decades and won awards for them.","Well documentary is one sided hit piece, so whatever floats your boat",movies
"Such a personal decision my friend. For me, I really love film, so missing out on Allen films would be a huge blind spot in film history.

"Watch “Allen v. Farrow” and then decide.

I wonder how many of those viewers didn't make it til the end.,"I made it about 20 to 30 minutes before I started fast forwarding and finally read the plot on wikipedia. The first film keeps itself grounded to reality and the plot could be plausible. Even the majority of the jokes from 1988 hold up today. 


The new movie is messy and quickly falls into the traps of most comedic sequels. Too many callbacks, jokes that will feel dated within a year and some scenes that feel like they belong in a parody movie. But most importantly the second film doesn't feel grounded to reality or to the rules set by the first film. The example I would use is Akeem's father. King Jaffe Joffer is in bed and is dying. The character we knew from the first film was this strong hard ass with a soft side for his son and mother. Now he is limp dick old man who basically gives up on his son because he couldn't deliver a heir. Jokes about how his son will be assassinated within a month of his death knowing his wife will be a widow and his daughters will not have a father. And then requests that they have his funeral while he is still alive which turns into what I can only describe as a parody of the movie. This is a sharp contrast from the character in the first movie. Then we bring in a voodoo witch doctor and a scene that is arguably rape. And shit just goes off the rails quickly.


Its a forgettable sequel to a great movie.",movies

"One pick for me would be David Lowery.  Pretty much every film he's made has been extremely enjoyable for me, and even though he's done a Disney film, I feel like he's not that well-known to your average moviegoer and thus not an icon yet.  I'm sure if his career continues at the pace it's been going, he'll get to that status eventually.

For another director I really like who's not an ""icon,"" but for a different reason, I'd go with Ron Howard.  Now, everyone knows who Ron Howard is, but I don't think he's seen as an auteur in the same way David Lynch or Martin Scorsese are.  He's not an icon of cinema because he seems like more of a ""hired hand"" (and I think that is true to a large extent - he'll usually come to a project after a script is already developed).  Yet I think his directorial chops are very solid, and while he's made his fair share of bad movies, I also think his direction is an underrated contributing factor to the greatness of some films like Apollo 13 or Cinderella Man.","If you like David Lowery, check out Dustin Guy Defa. David produces his films and they’re friends - Bad Fever is phenomenal but may be hard to find.",movies
"James Foley, if only for Glen Garry Glen Ross, and Confidence.  He also did the shifty shades sequels(lol), but you can't polish a turd.  Can't blame him for that shit.  ;)

Edward Zwick, I don't see his name talked about that often, but Glory, The Last Samurai, The Siege, Blood Diamond, and Defiance are all solid to great.","Zwick was one of my favourite working filmmakers until the mid-2010s. Even if I didn't always like his films, I respected his choice of material (R-rated dramas with a social commentary bent told on a big-budget scale) and just thought he had really good instincts. Even lesser fare like Love & Other Drugs has some powerful stuff, like the scene where Gyllenhaal talks to the older husband of the woman with Parkinson's disease. Sad to see him slumming it with the Jack Reacher sequel and other movies that don't exist in recent years.",movies
"Walter Hill would probably top that list for me, he's directed some great iconic movies and actually has a deep bench. The Warriors, 48 Hours, The Driver, Hard Times, Undisputed, Southern Comfort, Extreme Prejudice, Tresspass, and Streets of Fire are all just awesome movies, and even his less successful ones like Last Man Standing are still watchable and have their own coolness.

John Dahl made two of my favorite neo-noir, with Red Rock West and The Last Seduction, as a poker player I'll always love Rounders, and Joy Ride is just a shitload of fun. 

I'm also a big fan of Carl Franklin, though he hasn't directed a ton of movies and like Dahl has moved mostly into TV directing, both One False Move and Devil In A Blue Dress are just great great movies. Out of Time is also a pretty solid 90s thriller.

I also think John Michael McDonagh is better than Martin McDonagh. In Bruges is great, but both Calvary and The Guard are better than anything else Michael has done. Granted, John's War on Everyone is godawful, but I don't think Three Billboards is very good at all, and Seven Psychopaths is entertaining but pretty uneven.","You and I seem to have the same taste.

Denis Villeneuve and Edgar Wright haven't put a foot wrong for me. Christopher McQuarrie is also consistently good.,"Villeneuve's headed for icon status pretty soon, though, I'd say.

"While William Friedkin's influence can continue to be tracked in pop culture, I hardly see anyone on /r/movies talk about his films, outside of maybe The Exorcist.

He seems to not have the mainstream recognition of his contemporaries despite making so many masterworks of action and character. With each movie of his I watch I am astounded at how immaculate of a director he is and how many films this sub, and people as a whole, may love without realizing how often Friedkin did it first.

He is one of the all-time greats and I wish more people realized that and pursued his filmography outside of The Exorcist.

But it depends on how you define icon, I guess.",Genuinely curious—what would you consider some of those influential (yet still underrated) masterworks to be? You mentioned people’s focus on The Exorcist so I’d love to hear about the other films of his that should be recognized.

one of my absolute fav indie directors is Jim Jarmusch. his films have a really real moment to moment feeling that I haven't been able to see anywhere else.

The hipsters love coffee and cigarettes and dead man .",movies
"Edgar Wright, hands down. Moat people have never heard of the man, but in my book one of the best directors currently alive, and *by farrrrr* the best comedy director I have ever encountered. Wright manages to turn the most basic things like editing, exposition dumps, and scene transitioning and turns them into something special or hilarious. 

Also, every single person who hasn't seen his films needs to go do that right fucking now.","What do you mean most people haven't heard of Edgar Wright?  He's extremely popular, especially on this sub.",movies
"Wilson Yip and Jesse V Johnson. For action films with solid, clean fight scenes they're the best I've seen. Every hit is clear and technical, camera moves are smooth, and editing actually holds the shot. Yip is known for directing Flashpoint, Ip Man 1-4 and Johnson made The Debt Collectors 1 and 2, Avengement, Triple Threat.

Johnson films usually have a simple story with an acceptable reason to fight while Yip films have a meaningful, underlying message about life.","Nice shout for JVJ. I love Avengement and while Triple Threat is a little cheesy and didn't *quite* live up to it's potential, it's still a movie I quite enjoy as well.",movies
"Joe Wright - Pride & Prejudice, Atonement, Hanna. He did The Darkest Hour too. While he's had some hiccups recently, Pride & Prejudice was such a phenomenal feature film debut. It's one of my favourite films and Atonement is so beautiful. It's a great adaptation too. 

After him I'd say another Wright, Edgar. Although to film fans he's definitely iconic, he doesn't seem to have the same gravitas as his contemporaries in mainstream media and I think it's due to not being nominated for major awards. His films are always really fun and people enjoy them, but the level of detail they have isn't necessarily noticed which is such a shame. He really is up there with the greats of film direction/editing. The precision is always insane. He doesn't get enough recognition but his next film looks SO good. Fingers crossed for awards season 2022.",Atonement is brilliantly  made.,movies

His filmography at this point feels incredibly eclectic, but he's shown total command of his craft through everything. 

I'm also a huge fan of some international filmmakers whose names might not be in the mainstream in the English world, like Christian Petzold from Germany, Joko Anwar from Indonesia, and Na Hong-jin from South Korea.","I will forever be irritated that Andy Muschietti got to make *It* instead of Fukunaga.

"I’ve always felt I’ve been closer to being in Shawn’s shoes but that also means I am intrigued with *some* of Andre’s ideas and conclusions. I really liked the notion that the free thinking phenomenon burned bright and fast in the 60s but died afterwards and ever since civilization has been on a downward spiral. But then, some things he spouts are nonsense, like comparing the New York lifestyle to living in a *concentration camp*. I wanted to smack him. 

So I think Shawn has a tighter claim to moral uprightness and consistency, but Andre’s willing curiosity to explore trains of thought that go to strange places is appealing in its way.","Agreed. I think part of the beauty of the film is that neither one is right and / or wrong. They're both very smart and full of shit in equal measures.

I have to confess that my slightly less sympathetic view of Andre is colored by my own experiences living in NYC for 20 years. For most of that time, my life was way closer to Shawn's - aspiring writer, struggling to make ends meet, taking day jobs to support myself and still never able to afford to eat a restaurant like the Cafe des Artistes. And like Shawn, I knew my fair share of artists whose success was largely attributable to the fact that they had big fat trust funds to fall back on while they ""struggled."" Like Andre, none (well, most) of these people were really bad or mean-spirited people, they just didn't get that most people didn't have the luxury to, say, take six months to live in the Sahara on the off-chance that they'll be inspired to create a new work based on the Little Prince.

I saw this film because of the [Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/a36pal/my_dinner_with_abed/) episode but to be honest: I didn't get it or Tarantino spoiled character conversations for me.,"I have no doubt in my mind that Tarantino was at least partially inspired by this film re: the importance of dialogue. It may seem different to Tarantino's dialogue because his characters are hipster gangster types more likely to snarky snappy patter, while Shawn and Gregory are theater professionals and therefore more likely to ""monologue.""",movies
"Just saw this two months ago because Richard Linklater mentioned it as an inspiration for Before Sunrise (which is a personal favorite of mine). Loved the film. The conversations are far more dense than what they have in Before Sunrise, but just as engaging. I actually enjoyed it so much I bought the screenplay and acted it out to myself.

The one thing I don’t understand is that one part that Andre talks about toward the end of the film. He talks about how he worked on this building (I think it was in Norway, or Sweden, or some European country.) He talks about how they built this roof that wasn’t attached to the main structure of the building. Somehow they were able to build this roof so that it could open up but also remain completely secure, all with only some stones holding it down. Honestly it was very confusing to follow and didn’t make any sense at all to me. Do you know what he was talking about and do you know if this building is real?","I'm pretty sure he said Norway. And that makes sense as Norway does seem to have more than its fair share of UFOlogists ([https://www.visitnorway.com/media/news-from-norway/mysterious-light-phenomenon-inspires-ufo-camp-in-hessdalen/](https://www.visitnorway.com/media/news-from-norway/mysterious-light-phenomenon-inspires-ufo-camp-in-hessdalen/).) 

At any rate, I don't know if the building he mentions was real, but I do think the point of him bringing it up was to praise the idea of taking an idea as fundamental and universal as a building and upending it. Based on the context of the conversation at that point, he seems to be arguing that rational thinking as exemplified in the scientific method had become limiting. The idea being that deliberately building a structure so contrary to logical rules about how to build a house was a bold creative gesture that pushed its builders toward a heightened reality.

"The Blade trilogy was produced at New Line Cinema, which is owned by Warner Bros. Recently they've dipped their toes into the DCEU with Shazam. I think that probably means they could one day appear on HBO Max, but I'm not 100% sure. 

The Ghost Rider films were made by Sony (like Spider-Man). Although the rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios in 2013, Sony will always own those two movies. They don't have their own streaming service right now, so they could license these movies out to someone else, alongside their Spider-Man movies. They haven't yet so far. 

The Punisher movies were made by Lionsgate. They will always own these movies, but they could one day be licensed to another streamer. 

Howard the Duck was made by Universal, and like The Incredible Hulk will not stream on Disney+ unless a deal is reached. Maybe one day we'll see them both on Peacock. 

The X-Men, Fantastic Four and Daredevil / Electra movies are a unique case because Disney bought Fox. That gave them complete ownership of the films and allowed them to come to Disney+. That isn't guaranteed to happen for pretty much any of the other legacy films, sadly. 

The older stuff gets even more complicated, but most of it does not belong to Disney. 1990 Captain America is MGM. The Incredible Hulk (television show) is Universal, but the television movies that came later were made by New World, who got bought out by News Corp (AKA Fox), now owned by Disney. However I don't know if they would need to sign new deals with the actors and producers to stream this content.","Wow, this was exactly the type of answer I was looking for! Thank you! Very interesting to see how all these characters were spread out and it makes sense that Feige wants to keep everything in house nowadays, even avoiding Marvel Entertainment.",movies
Disney doesn't have the distribution rights to those movies. They could make an effort to license them all for Disney+ at some point if they really wanted to but that's probably going to cost more money than it's worth.,"Yeah I agree, that does sound like a major hassle. If anything, they’d focus on getting The Incredible Hulk (2008) from Universal and the Spidey movies.",movies

"I feel like ""i didnt need to know the history"" is kind of a cop out complaint. I base it on how well did they tell that story and can it get me past my distaste of knowing the history of xenomorphs. I think prometheus did a way better job than covenant did because it did leave some mystery there still while explaining a little bit and providing new creatures. The only complaint i understand and sort of agree about prometheus is how easily the scientists were killed because they were too busy geeking out about new biological discoveries to worry about their own safety. At the same time humans can be that fucking stupid when theyre excited about something so i cant be too mad at it.","I can agree with the argument about scientists, this type of thing is even more significant to me in Covenant. What I mean by that is, in Prometheus they were scientists so ok, they were geeking out, I am able to accept that but in Covenant, they were not on science or exploration mission. Risks they took by landing on unexplored planet basicly ruined perfectly planned exploration mission and put lives of thousands in danger.",movies

">which try to explain origin of xenomorphs 

And that is my problem with the Prequels. I dont need to know the origin of the Xenomorphs. There Aliens, thats enough. 
Knowing there origin Story takes away the mysterie.

I have other issus with the Prequels but this one is the biggest.",Also some of the plot was convoluted and had some contradictions that were hard to reconcile with previous canon about  the alien . They should’ve left it alone,movies
"I liked Prometheus but to understand the vitriol around that movie you’ve got to look at what happened around the movie. There was so much hype for that movie, like heaps. Damon Lindelof wrote the movie and he also helped steer the marketing campaign. This is the guy who was the showrunner for Lost which at the time was also a HUGE deal.

The movie was never going to live up to expectations and people felt cheated by the third act. It’s “not” and Alien movie up until that point and I think people wanted all original or all Alien. Like I said I still really liked it but I fell in love with the visuals of that movie. Other people only care about plot and story and I think they’re missing out.

As for Alien: Covenant I personally didn’t really connect with that film. I wanted something more akin to Prometheus and I think there was some course correction that didn’t stick the landing. All the Michael Fassbender stuff is bizarre bordering on comical.

All that said the only two critically lauded entries are the first two and this is a six-movie franchise so obviously people like them.

Check out AVP 1 & 2 if you haven’t already. They’re worth a watch if you’re doing a deep dive on the franchise.","I fell in love with visuals too, in 1979 movie and also in both prequels. Thanks for the tip, will check out those AVP movies.",movies
[deleted],"I didn´t really think about the genre thing, good point.",movies
"Thanks for your opinions. I can understand the argument about movies taking away mystery around the aliens. In this regard, I would say that Prometheus still left some space for imagination, Covenant took it away completely. For me, expect the crane scene, most stupid thing in Covenant was the mindset of crew who scrapped whole perfectly planned colonisation mission and went to unexplored planet and again, took some extreme risks which resulted only in casualities and whole mission ruined. Anyway, I like more mystery too so yes, I understand it and I have no argument against it. To me personally, mystery around space jockeys was maybe even more interesting than xenomorphs.","Yeah covenant required too many Leaps, plot contrivances and bad logic by the main characters to be taken seriously",movies
"Speaking as a huge admirer of the prequels, after years of reading vitriol about them on the internet, I came to the conclusion that lots of people dislike them because they perceive them as pretentious for attempting to broaden and enrich the *Alien* mythos with new thematic tangents. They also feel that *Covenant* in particular strips the xenos of their mystery.

(Naysayers will claim that it's because the ""scripts suck"" and the ""characters make dumb decisions"", but that's just nitpicking to mask their real problem with the movies, in my opinion.) 

If *Prometheus* had been a direct prequel with all the usual franchise tropes, lots of drooling xenos and little to no originality or imagination, it probably would have been accepted by the die-hards - and would barely be discussed nowadays, if I may add. Ridley Scott had wanted to explore the origins of the xenos and specifically of the Space Jockey for decades, and the then Fox head Tom Rothman actually encouraged him not to make a rehash and go for something substantially original - it's ironic that so-called movie buffs whine so much about Hollywood's lack of new ideas on the internet, but when a major studio attempts to do something different, they tear it to shreds.","True, I guess you can never satisfy everyone. I personally like direction that prequels took and attempt to make them a different from original movies, although there were definitely some flaws and weird logic of characters. Also, I really fell in love with visuals of both movies and David as a character is great I would say.",movies
Agree that the prequels just kill too much of the mystery and coolness of the Xenomorphs. I didn’t need to know absolutely every detail of how Michael Fassbender created them or whatever they explained.,And even their retcon of him creating them doesn’t hold up  upon a surface level inspection . Prometheus established the aliens existed thousands of year before the Prometheus crew even got there and David was created . There was a mural of an alien queen in the black oil chamber in Prometheus suggesting the xenomoroh existed prior to David creations of them in covenant . The only logical inference you can make is that he recreated an extinct alien species,movies
"> But for the series that defined home-video-sales? NADA

Tremors defined home video sales? How so?",It was actually really popular on vhs.,movies
You should do something about this.,"I have been emailing this to every link I can find for Universal, NBC and SyFy... nothing. 

They definitely don't want anyone digging deeper.

r/Truefilm just deleted it as it was gaining traction too...",movies
"Why are you obsessed with Tremors so much that you publish multiple rants about it.

It still boils down to the following: No matter what you say about how Universal is destroying the franchise, the studio is still making more Tremors movies. It doesn't matter if the actors hate the script, that the music contain spoilers, or they switched to a different production company because they are irrelevant points.

If Universal was trying to kill the franchise, it is much easier to stop making the movies. The studio is not. That alone disproves you main thesis.

It looks like you still haven't contacted the company directly for an official statement on the Tremors franchise. It would do a lot to dissuade the biased reporting you clearly are doing if you contact them instead of relying on second hand information you got from deep dives in the Internet.","Yeah Mr.Gross said they might make more movies if these succeed, but the thing is. We don’t know the budget of the movies. How will we know if the box office did or did not succeed the budget. How will we know if we will or will not get an 8th since we have no budget?

"Look, it's not a popular one to say the least, but as a teen, I found Toys to be a really unusual and interesting movie. I was drawn to anything that felt unusual, even if it was bad.

And I think if that movie were made today, it might resonate better. 

We're in a culture where children's entertainment is being consumed by adults, unironically. Graphic design is dominated by bold primary colors with no texture, many of the most popular games are Nintendo, or similarly drawing on kid stuff (Fall Guys, for example), played enthusiastically by people in their 30s, Kidcore is a fashion thing happening, Lolita fashion was happening, for a time, and more recently I think there's a push into strawberry shortcake stuff and happy pastels, a VR goggle fad, adults worshipping Ghibli, Pixar, and the classic Disney catalogue... there are people watching Teletubbies who don't even have kids. Even the clouds and field setting of Toys can now be looked back on with desktop Windows nostalgia.

We're shutting out the darkness, much more desperately than in the 20th century, by overcompensating with a ""new wholesome"".

There's a purity to that, but it's also weird and uncomfortable. I think that's how I'd describe Toys (1992).",I like your take on it. I agree. This movie was *weird* but I love it.,movies
What a nightmare or a movie.,"I saw this at the theater. My friend and I were dropped off at a crappy mall in Missouri and wanted to kill some time until his mom came back. ""Toys"" was our choice and I still feel like I need to request my money back.

"I think it's great.  The atmosphere and cinematography are incredible, and the themes are really interesting.  I like how the film has a very dreamlike feel in terms of pacing and lighting.  All of Kubrick's films are masterfully made, including this one.","I particularly loved his use of Christmas lights in the film and how the bulbs give off such a pleasant glow in dark rooms.  For a man who hadn't made a film in over a decade, he definitely showed with this film that he still had the ability to make something both eye-catching and thought-provoking.",movies
"The Christmas party scene is one of the most beautifully lit, perfectly shot sequences I've ever seen. You can put it up with Barry Lyndon with regard to technical mastery.",Eyes Wide Shut is definitely one of Kubrick's most beautiful films in my opinion along with Barry Lyndon and 2001.,movies
"I liked it because it's haunting music that was a trademark of all of Kubrick's films. He also pays a great deal of attention to symbolism and small details that require you watch the film many times to catch. The blues and reds certainly had meaning. Of course I've always found Kidman to be very sexy so her role in this just made it all the more intense. 

A lesser known fact: at one point in the movie and he music lyrics sound like they are being played backwards. They are. It is a prayer that has significant meaning to the story. 

I agree it isn't Kubricks best work, but it is thoughtful. There is a pretty good video on YouTube describing it. Caution: spoilers. 

https://youtu.be/PwJONQVnb8M","I actually knew about that fact concerning Jocelyn Pook's ""Masked Ball"" and I think it's funny how people often perceive it as satanic when it's actually the exact opposite.  Its use during the ceremony before the orgy may have played a factor in this, but its use made the ceremony even more unnerving, yet mesmerizing, to watch.",movies
"I share [this review](http://timkreider.com/introducing-sociology/) whenever I can. It does a lot to unlock what Kubrick might be up to in Eyes Wide Shut. I think the movie is up to par with Kubrick's others. Anyway, it definitely repays close analysis.","The only reason why I think the film isn't up to par with the others is because it doesn't feel 100% complete.  Sure, it clocks in at over two and a half hours but I truly believe that Kubrick would've wanted more for it in terms of post production.  His unfortunate passing prevented probably a lot more from being filmed and edited in / out (the man definitely loved to tinker with projects considered done, but were much further away from being finished than originally thought).",movies
"So if it was discussing violence, you would not mark it nsfw?",I would if the violence is excessive (like in de Palma's version of Scarface).,movies

"> Landis, in a 2005 interview, granted that Murphy had changed. “The guy on Trading Places was young and full of energy and curious and funny and fresh and great,” he explained. “The guy on Coming to America was the pig of the world — the most unpleasant, arrogant, bullshit entourage, just an asshole.”

WOW!","Wow, and he still worked with him on BHC3. I bet the filming was pretty tense between them. You could always tell in that movie that Eddie wasn’t himself and there was probably a lot of arguing on the set.",movies
"> Beyond questions of authorship, another quiet controversy haunted Coming to America in 1988 — a question of representation. In a New York Amsterdam News editorial (later republished, presumably for the benefit of white readers, in the Village Voice), Ali Rashid Abdullah wrote that “voices from the African-American community have, predictably, taken positions pro and con in relation to the imaging of African-Americans, as well as Africans, in Coming to America,” specifically regarding the scenes in Prince Akeem’s native Zamunda. Abdullah asked, pointedly, “Does Murphy help perpetuate a negative image of Africa — for the sake of a few laughs — at a time when blacks are beginning to identify with their African roots?”

If someone told me I had to get with my white roots, i'd say they were being racist.

The term African-American didn't start getting used until 1989 so this kind of retcons the history slightly.

Black people didn't really choose to adopt the African-American label. It was pushed on them by the media, social academics, and political groups who tend to benefit from racial marginalization.

The 80s were so anti-racist that Americans flipped to being racist again by forcing black people to be culturally segregated. Most black people in the US were born in the US and have no ties to Africa but between all the campaigns like US for Africa, Sun City, We are the World, etc black Americans were shoved into adopting the label.

Look at 48 Hours or Trading Places compared to Coming to America.

Trading Places is probably one of the best movies about class, race, and income inequality. Coming to America is just about race. They flip a few stereotypical jokes but essentially, it's kind of cliché.","Most other countries black people still refer to themselves as black. You don't have African Canadians, or African Europeans. 

African American is actually technically the wrong term, if you were born in America. You'd technically be a American African if you were born in America. Or, like every other country, if you're born in that country, that's what you identify as, color isn't a factor. 

Example: A black guy born in Great Britain is called British. Not African British, or British African. He's British. He's also black. 

I've always wondered how black british people answer the race question for american websites. There's no black option. You have African American, and if you're British and black, you're neither of those things.",movies

JFK has entered the chat,"Bayuck 

And to the leyuuft",movies
"I think JFK is Costner's best performance and the best and most importantly nuttiest movie he's ever been a part of. However, I just watched Dances With Wolves on Netflix US for the first time in a long time and was struck by it.

First off, the worst thing to happen to this movie was the Oscars. Unfortunately, like a few Best Picture winners, it's gotten a bad reputation because it beat a more deserving and beloved movie over time in Goodfellas. That's led a lot of people to deride it as a bad movie, which it is definitely not, it just wasn't the best movie of that year. It's also one I see lumped into the White Savior category of movie too, and I think that's something interesting to examine as well, because depending on the actual definition of White Savior Movie, it's not really. It is about a white guy who learns about a non-white culture, but he doesn't save them really, he's not their hero. He just becomes a friend and warrior, another one of the tribe, and the movie is fairly respectful in its portrayal of Native Americans overall.

The movie as a whole is just a massive piece of art that is very different from anything Hollywood typically makes. All the technical elements are top notch: score, cinematography, costumes, and especially the production design, which feels like the 1860's and not a Hollywood version of it. You very much see what drew Costner to it, and I think it comes close to feeling like a vanity project, especially because he directed and stars in so much of it, but I think its quality manages to escape that. The pacing is weird; the prologue of the Civil War is well shot, but feels disjointed and melodramatic in a way the rest of the movie isn't. There are a couple of wacky elements that stick out: the first commander who kills himself for unclear reasons, as well as the army men toward the end. The movie works best when it's Costner alone, especially in the first half, or Costner trying to initially navigate the relations with the Sioux. The buffalo hunt is awesomely done and again not the kind of set piece Hollywood really does anymore. For me, the second half and ending start to drag on just too long, as the movies pace stops feeling deliberate and moves to sluggish; Costner is captured and fighting to escape for what feels like a long time, and everything after also doesn't really do anything new with the themes we've already explored, so it feels repetitive. 

As I said earlier, Costner's performance is great overall; what doesn't work about it is the narration, which feels like it was written by a different writer. Graham Greene and the other Native actors are immensely watchable, and their reactions and movements in the scenes where we don't get their subtitles speaks volumes. Mary McDonnell also gives a good performance, but her character is probably the weakest part of the movie and also ties into the most problematic element, which is that the movie felt Costner needed a white actress in this Sioux tribe to fall in love with. Overall the movie is worth the watch and a beautiful letter to what really was the old west, before the wild west overtook it.","""There are a couple of wacky elements that stick out: the first commander who kills himself for unclear reasons, as well as the army men toward the end.""

I actually really like that character. He's basically this weird guy that's been broken by his experiences in the war. Him killing himself is an important plot point. And the scene leading up to it sold his unhinged nature well imo.",movies

I know nothing about the guy or his political beliefs although personally I do think sucker punch was misogynistic and kinda sexualised trauma

More importantly I wanna know why everyone  on Reddit is so obsessed with a filmmaker who just ain’t that great....I guess cause he makes DC movies",">	I do think sucker punch was misogynistic and kinda sexualised trauma 

I remember reading a story a while back that the original cut of the movie was actually leaning a lot closer to being much more feminist in nature, but then the studio made him cut it to shreds.  But I don't have any examples or a source.  Sorry.

"So the changes that Zach Snyder makes when he adapts a work are interesting. When he adapts 300, he doesn't change anything. When adapting the Superman, he tells superman it would be wrong to save his own father, and a bus full of children, because then people might expect him to save other people and where would it end.

Snyder has really weird ideas about authority. Superman shouldn't save people, because Zach Snyder doesn't believe that society has an obligation to help people. This is straight out of Ayn Rand and a pretty good demonstration that Snyder's ideology informs his storytelling. At the same time, he believes that some people, like Superman, are just better than others, and they should have unlimited authority. Justice League has no oversight and no accountability. I'm not that into the comics, but I'm pretty sure they at least respected the sovereignty of nations, even if it didn't com up often. Snyder is anti authoritarian unless he likes the person with authority.

A common element in his movies is civilization being under threat of a nameless, faceless horde who will destroy all our values. This is explicit in 300, but is also present in Justice League and Dawn of the Dead.

These are all from movies he made, not from interviews, but come on, these situations are invented. He's creating situations and the solutions are going to align with his ideology, that's something every author does. It's only a question of how overt they are.

In summary, he believes that civilization is under constant threat, that a single strong man is needed to stop the threat, and that person shouldn't have any kind of accountability. That's not exactly a fascism, but damn if it doesn't quack like one.

That said, none of this would be something people talked about if his movies weren't boring.","Isn’t the whole theme of Man of Steel about Superman wrestling with the conflicting ideologies of his fathers? Jor-El wants Clark to be a beacon for humanity to aspire to, whilst Papa Kent wants him to hide his gift, even at the expense of others.

Clark even has the conversation with the priest about taking a leap of faith and trusting in humanity.",movies
"Why ""supposedly"" a fan of Ayn Rand? He's been pretty explicit that he's a fan. ""I've always felt like **The Fountainhead** was such a thesis on the creative process and what it is to create something."" 

If a theme comes up a lot in a director's movies, it tends to color how people view that director. His versions of Batman and Superman are deeply unpleasant and he's repeatedly returned to exploring Objectivist ideas, especially in his super-hero movies. I find his films deeply unpleasant and I feel like he very often seems to miss the heart of the characters or the points that the source material is making, but I don't think he's a fascist (also, he \*did\* endorse Biden in the last election, which makes it hard to think he's actually very right wing, personally).",He doesn’t understand characters. He understands the art and the basic story. For example he completely didn’t understand the parody aspect of Watchmen. Its an incredibly beautiful movie aesthetically but devoid of even 50% of Alan Moore’s actual point of Watchmen,movies
They must've missed the part where he endorsed Joe Biden,"I mean,its tricky having a good career in Hollywood if you openly support Trump. Most Trump supporting celebs are retired or washed out.",movies
He isn’t a right wing fascist. That’s hyperbolic. But he is definitely too Randian in his works to the point he definitely doesn’t understand the randian aspect of Rorschach because of that. 300 is a Frank Miller wankfest and if you adapt any later Miller work its going to be problematic,"I suppose you could wonder how much of his stuff is ideologically ditto'ing Miller, and how much is Snyder just not really thinking too hard about what his stories are telling. But yeah, this is a lot of it either way.",movies
"There are definitely some questionable themes in his work and the Rand thing is dubious (though I honestly buy his justification that he just likes the novel because it's insane and about architecture and sex) but he seems like a nice enough guy - I think there's a weird desire for him to be a bad guy so that disliking his movies can be an indicator of good moral standing rather than just an opinion. 

He also comes off as a dickhead sometimes in public interviews (""You're living in a fucking dream world"", ""Batman could get raped in my movie"", ""This movie is for grownups"") which doesn't help.","So basically, he's what James Gunn used to be-- an edgy, immature kind-of asshole who likes to shock people.

But unlike Gunn, Snyder hasn't really grown out of it yet",movies
">Is it just because he's (supposedly) a fan of Ayn Rand? 

Pretty much,he's very openly a Rand fan so probably a objevtividt/libertarian.

Most superheroes are libertarian/fascist characters. The whole crux of Watchmen is about that very thing - classic superheroes are libertarian and bordering on fascist.Alan Moore called the KKK as the proto-superhero archetype.

Snyder also made 300 which was always ultra-conservative cause of Frank Miller who is/was super rightwing(check out Holy Terror) at worst and super libertarian at best(check out TDKR)

So you have a guy who is himself openly right-wing working in a genre with a history of being right-wing and you can see how things look overall.To those who have a problem with right-wingers thats a red flag.

Sucker Punch is a different story,I have no clue what Snyder is trying to say with it.","Hes not a libertarian, he was advocating for democrats in 2020. He's probably just a liberal who liked the fountainhead.",movies
"I assume for a bunch of vocal people, there is the logic « I don't like something -> the guy who made it is Hitler ». 

Or maybe it's his fan-base who gives him a bad reputation, but I'm not even sure his fan-base is particularly more right-leaning that the average person.",But in this case he admires Margaret Sanger that created Planned Parenthood and Rand who both pushed eugenics to kill all of our kind.

"Yeah, maybe the genre is just falling out of focus. And don't get me started about the reuse of ideas.

"I noticed this with *It* and *It Chapter 2*. Those movies have really weird pacing. They're both like 3 hours long, nothing really happens, they just fly through events. 

For example, the scene where Bill sees a kid die in the house of mirrors. There's no follow up, we don't see him react, it just *happens* and then the scene switches. Normally something so fucked up would mean the movie is escalating, right? Nope, there's still another hour of bullshit exposition scenes and forced character drama. The movie doesn't really escalate into anything bigger until the last half hour (which contains some of the dumbest fucking things I've ever seen in a horror movie, by the way)

"The Master for me. Others here have already gave great arguments for it, but I'll try to offer something myself. The Master offers so much room for interpretation for the psyche of the characters. People can have different views of how they feel about a character. Also, some scenes just have so many ways of being looked at. The end where Lancaster Dod sings to Freddie is weird, funny, beautiful, and heartwarming. The movie does this almost VERY unconventional love story about longing for a place in the world. And the very end makes the viewer question the protagonists arc. Did they really change? What have they learned? It might be my favorite film ever",This. This is one of the key reasons why The Master takes the cake for me. PTA was wise in leaving enough in the film up for debate without ever definitively explaining things.,movies
"I prefer TWBB everyday and twice on Sunday over The Master.  I get bored with The Master.   
 The acting is great in both movies, and they both have their monsters, but Freddie comes off as such a crude troglodyte that I don't enjoy spending any time with him or really any of the other characters in The Master.  I find Daniel's relationships with other people much more intriguing than any of the relationships in The Master.","Gotcha. Do you feel no compassion or sympathy for Freddie whatsoever?

"Not a lot of surprises tonight, which was interesting. The craft categories especially for the films fell in line with what a lot of people were predicting. For me the biggest takeaways:

* Boseman and Kaluuya are sweeping the Big 5 televised awards

* Promising Young Woman in Original Screenplay means there might be more of a race there with Sorkin than some are predicting
* Sound of Metal showed up in the Editing tie is a good boost that it needed
* Mulligan needed this win after the GG loss, so there's gonna be an interesting race
* Supporting Actress is literally anyone's game right now. Exciting
* Nomadland is secure in its frontrunner position for Picture, but it's leaving the comfortableness of Critics now.

He’s first billed on the poster and everything though, so not sure how they got away with it. The whole time I was watching the movie, I was like how are they calling him the supporting actor?

Watching FWWM with The Missing Pieces is like seeing the blueprint for season 3, a more distinct stepping stone than the theatrical cut from the original show.","The one thing I really love about Fire Walk With Me is how it pulled back the curtain and gave us an expanded look at the Black Lodge.

Just watched Mulholland drive the other day.","That's exactly how I felt when I first saw Eraserhead.  I was completely on edge and uncomfortable the whole time, yet I was also excited to see what surreal trick Lynch would pull out of his hat next.",movies
I'm not answering your question but I wanna say I recently started watching Twin Peaks. It really is something else haha. Never seen something like it.,"After seeing Eraserhead, I immediately watched all of Twin Peaks over the course of three days.  It's amazing how Lynch's style meshed with television so well.  So well in fact that I wish he'd do more outside of Twin Peaks.",movies
"Twin Peaks - Fire Walk With Me.

I really enjoyed the show, but part of me wondered what it would've been like it wasn't under the restraints of network television because there were some really dark and outright creepy moments in the show intertwined with goofy ones. I kind of felt like there was an element waiting to be unleashed, and that's what we get from TPFWM.

I really feel like some of Lynch's best work is in this film. The imagery, music... Some great stuff to be seen here. I often see the infamous diner scene from Mulholland Drive get discussed as one of Lynch's scariest moments, but I really felt like the oppressive eeriness of Fire Walk With Me rivals it, if not surpasses it entirely. 

And not to mention Sheryl Lee's performance as Laura Palmer. She's fantastic throughout the series, but her performance in Fire Walk With Me was utterly spellbinding in every sense of the word. How she didn't become a household name after that boggles my mind.",I definitely agree with you! Watching Laura's downward spiral was truly heartbreaking and Sheryl's acting made the character's fatal fall from grace even more tragic.  I was also happy to see her again in Twin Peaks: The Return and how her first scene followed up on Laura's promise to Dale from the original show.  25 (26 when the first Return episode aired) years had passed and Sheryl hadn't missed a beat (and boy could she still belt out a good scream).,movies
"Elephant Man. No question, David Lynch’s finest hour. When Dr. Treves questions himself and wonders if he’s any better than the carnies who were torturing and exploiting John and asks if he’s a good man or a bad man and his wife has to reassure him. And when John tells Dr. Treves his life is full because he knows he’s loved.","For me it's his most emotional without the distracting surrealism (not a complaint, I just found this film to have a more impactful connection)",movies
"Dune--I don't think I'll feel the same impact from the new film (I certainly didn't from the miniseries) as I did from this version. I know he wasn't happy with it, and there are certainly flaws in it (omg the Baron wow) but that imagery just doesn't leave me. Although I must admit a fondness for his Rabbits series as well.",I love Dune for what it got right rather than hate it for what it got wrong.,movies
"I think his most emotionally powerful film is undoubtedly The Elephant Man. A masterpiece.

The most representative of his overall style? Mulholland Drive or Eraserhead. 

My favourite has to be Blue Velvet though. It combines his surreal, nightmarish sensibilities with a more straightforward plot very successfully; making it easier to digest than some of his other work, while at the same time being atmospherically amazing. Not to mention the ultimate Dennis Hopper performance.","Hopper's performance as Frank was so good! I knew the protagonists were in deep trouble when I first saw his first scene.  First impressions are everything and that one intense scene was enough to show that this guy was psychotic, abusive, and dangerous.  It even makes me wonder if Kyle MacLachlan's looks of fear in scenes with Dennis were out of genuine dread.  I'd be scared if I were in his position!",movies
"My personal favorite movie is Mulholland Drive, but an argument could be made for all of his films. His quality level has remained incredibly consistent over his career. Even though you said ""movie"" I believe his crown jewel is Twin Peaks: The Return.","The Return is astounding and the quality of it is up to par with his film work.  I was a little worried when it was announced for Showtime, but it being there was a great move so that he and Mark Frost could do whatever they wanted without any major interference from network execs.  I especially loved the episode ""Gotta Light"" and how it delved so deeply into the more surreal side of Twin Peaks.",movies
"I've only seen Elephant Man, Easierhead, Blue Velvet, and The Straight Story. With that said, Elephant Man and The Straight Story. 

Gonna have to watch Blue Velvet again because I don't remember much since I was drinking heavily while watching it.","Blue Velvet is a great one for repeat viewing, no matter what the occasion may be.  I'm also happy to see more and more people mention The Straight Story.",movies
"I think Dune was his best film, while I really like all of his other films, he stretched his creative muscles on Dune.","That's an interesting take, seems like that was the film he had the least creative control over.",movies

Kerry Conran - Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"Kerry Conran has to be among the most head-scratching of those listed here.

He, along with his brother, essentially created the CGI effect filled film, something which changed Hollywood completely.  *Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow* was a radical departure from the regular effects used by movies to that point and it *still* IMHO looks pretty damn good.

But...

The film wasn't quite as exciting, IMHO (again!) as the effects and while it started well, I thought it didn't stick the landing.

Having said that, you would figure they would follow that film up with something else but... nothing.

Part of the problem might be due to the fact that the film didn't do all that well at the box office and, further to that, they may not have played the Hollywood game very well which turned off potential investors into future films.  There's a great article about them here:

Neither of them were critical darlings, but both were commercially successful and they're still talked about among horror fans twenty years later.

That seems like it would at least be a solid foundation for an emerging career, but his IMDB page stops dead completely after *Ghost Ship*. His only credit since then is from last year when he did the director's commentary for the Shout Factory release of *Ghost Ship*.

"A lot of people who may not seem depressive and otherwise seem like they should be happy with where their life is can be hiding severe depression.

I know I'm bipolar and overall my life is great, but that doesn't stop the uncontrollable suicidal thoughts that I've had since I was a kid.

The big thing is to get help if you feel you can't take it.  It's always going to be better to see if waiting depression out or treatment is a possibility as suicide is pretty final.  Personally my coping mechanism is just choosing something to look forward to, like ""I'll wait to kill myself until after this trip or some game comes out.""  Then seek help during that and choose new things to wait for after if the depression hasn't subsided.

Also, if you feel like medication hasn't worked before look into cognitive behavioral therapy or in general ways to catch and redirect toxic thoughts.  In the meantime press your doctor, telling them you have intrusive thoughts of death is a way to express that you feel suicidal without them needing to put you in inpatient, though sometimes inpatient can help (I've not been, but have had friends with good experiences.)  Saying that will encourage them to take figuring out a better medication for you more seriously, otherwise they may think you are managing depression well and just don't like some side effects.

For people not suffering from this I don't mean to be a downer, but generally there's not much you can do to fix the problem as past a point it is just a chemical and/or deeply ingrained childhood trauma problem.  The best way to help is to not get pissed off if they drop off the face of the earth for periods and try to be supportive when they do reach out.  Meet them where they are rather than expecting them to function where you are.",Very well put. I love your last sentence and hope that people  take it to heart.

It’s really important to note that depression is a liar - it tells you that you’re not good enough, and that’s not true. You’re not a burden, you are cared about and you are important.

 Also, suicide doesn’t end the pain, that pain gets passed down. The last point is tough to read, but it is statistically a fact. Knowing this might help prevent someone from carrying out that act of suicide. 

If someone you know seems to have changed their behaviours from their usual habits, or seem to have withdrawn more from talking, please check up on them. People feeling incredibly low don’t always reach out because they don’t want to ‘bother’ anyone.","So true, what you said. Someone I knew killed themselves almost two months ago. A year ago his dad killed himself. 

Like you said, the pain gets passed down and thrown at people you wouldn't even expect it to. I never fully understood this until i experienced it. I never knew someone who killed themself before. It taught me a lot about life, but also has greatly haunted me. I will never forget him.

I kept looking up his obituary for weeks. I kept thinking maybe it was a dream. I was in denial. Everytime I looked it up, it was still there. Just his name, and a birth date to an end date. I would stare at it in disbelief.

I wish I could have helped this person. In the end he became very quiet and withdrew from us. Or was he always like this? I didnt even know him for a year. I don't know who he really was. 

I stopped reaching out because I didn't want to keep bothering him or overstep boundaries, seeing as we weren't close and I don't really know his true thoughts about me. 

I'm on the spectrum and don't always get social cues, so I thought I shouldn't talk to him, because I'd over stepped other people's boundaries when I was simply trying to become their friend or talk to them. I'm basically a weirdo and I figured he probably didn't want me to talk to him and see if he was okay. I'll never know. I was just tired of being rejected by everyone, that I felt I should keep to myself. 

Still, even if we had talked, I don't know if I could have made a difference. It's difficult when it's a co worker you are not close to... I got the vibe he was suicidal, but I didn't think it was going to happen so soon. I wanted to form a relationship with him, I guess I was stupid to think that since we were both depressed, maybe we could become close and make each other's lives better. 

That was all in my head, anyway... something I secretly wished for. But I heard he got back with his gf so I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. I know, I mention that a lot, because I tend to do that with people and I'm trying to be better. I don't want to be a socially awkward person people think are weird. I've struggled with that my whole life, so.... ya I hate myself and have no self esteem. 

I wanted to look at his obituary again today. Again, it's been almost two months and we weren't close. We were co workers who rarely worked together. And yet, I still am somehow aching for him. He probably didn't give a fuck about me. But for some reason... here I am typing this.",movies

"One of the most common misconceptions I see all the time is that older movies are viewed as antiquated (by default) and don't stand up to modern stuff. I'd encourage anyone who feels like that to explore older films, especially the widely praised ones.

I'd argue any critically acclaimed movie in the last hundred years (such as The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly) can easily go toe-to-toe with today's movies.","In my opinion a lot of older films look better then modern films.

The “Machete Order” is: 
4, 5, THEN 2, 3, THEN 6, 7, 8, 9, 
then all other material in whatever order you want. 

I largely agree with this. Personally, I think the wiser take is “Rogue One”, 4,5, THEN JUST 3, then back on track to 6,7,8 but I’m not the genius who first thought of it!","I prefer it this way.

Rogue one,4,5,6,1,2, (clone wars TV series if you want but stop with 6 episodes left in the final season) watch episode 3 revenge of the sith, then finish up the Clone wars TV series, solo, 7,8,9 now go watch the other series like the mandolorian.",movies

Due to Covid many movie festivals stream their movies during the festival and sometimes for a few days afterwards.  For the better movies you often have to buy them early before they sell out.

Now imagine that instead of wealth, the issue is intellect or culture. Certain movies just get all *flashy* with their intellect or culture.

On the other hand you get films like mother! which are really pretentious, but have none of the subtlety or deeper meanings and just hit you over and over the head with some attempt at a deep metaphor when it’s just a simple story told in a complicated way.","I don't think Mother! was trying to be super complicated or deep. Once you pick up on what he's going for, it's just a sit back and watch thing. Then, you kind of have to decide why. Why would he do this? Aronofsky struggled with religion at some point in his life. We know that. And this seems like his response to that. It's like he's trying to show how absurd these things are, but not faulting anyone. Just showing what humans are doing to the world, itself, regardless of whether or not the story of creation is true.

I do agree that it helps Kaufman though. He criticizes himself so much in Adaptation, worrying about that kind of thing. And you can't just point it out, making it okay. You have to think about whether you're telling a good story or just stuck up your own ass. It has saved me many times, worrying about that.",movies
"I think pretentious is a pretty crappy criticism. 

People use it when they think a film is ""full of itself"" but that seems like such a subjective metric.

Often it seems people who don't understand a specific piece of art use this word. Tons of critical say Lars von Trier movies are pretentious. I find them genius.,movies
"tl;dr -- yes, it's a bad thing for a film to be; it's also, in my opinion, thrown around a lot when it shouldn't be

Badness is easy. Just look at the definition:

Pretentious:

>Attempting to impress by affecting greater importance or merit than is actually possessed.
>>‘pretentious art films’

The question (when we're trying to decide whether to use it) is therefore... does a film (e.g. Birdman) act like it is more important than it actually is?

And that raises the question of how you would tell if a film thinks it's more important than it is.

(The merit bit is interesting... it drifts far too close to the notion of objective quality of art. Of course, maybe that's the problem with a film and it's backers... they think there is such a thing as Good Film and they try to consciously create a Good Film... but mostly I think there's something weird about saying ""the film thinks it is a better film than it is"".)

So, Birdman is a story about someone trying to reclaim their relevance. That's a non trivial idea and I personally don't think it's trite either. The film isn't pretentious, it's just artsy (which is to say, it toys with abstraction).

Now compare The Thin Red Line. Like Birdman it has consciously artsy elements to it. These are a sign the film thinks it's doing something Really Important. And consequently, the movie is pretentious as fuck. Not because what it is saying is trivial but because it's trite. ""War is awful"" is dull on account of overuse. (Alternatively the people who made it are completely tone deaf and are telling the audience a point that's been articulated for a very, very long time.) We might compare other films with essentially the same point, e.g. Jarhead or more saliently (they came out the same year) Saving Private Ryan. They're not pretentious because they don't typically incorporate signifiers of ""importance"".

(I guess I should also compare 1917 since it does that ""one take"" thing Birdman does at times. That's just disorienting and distracting but because it's used constantly I'd call it an aesthetic... it's hard to claim it's being used to highlight anything since it's constant. Though maybe that's the point... it's a symbolic translation of the ideas about war the film is trying to convey, in which case the movie would be pretentious for the same reasons The Thin Red Line is. But, again, I find it unintentionally disorientating so pretentiousness is the last critique I want to make of 1917.)

Pretension:

>(often pretensions) A claim or aspiration to a particular quality

Calling a movie pretentious isn't a critique in and of itself... it's the conclusion to argument where you've laid out, firstly, what it is doing and secondly, how it presents itself as it does those things.

Birdman probably was meant to feel pretentious given the specific context it's in... actors trying to stake a claim to relevance when, you know, they're actors... but I would argue, even though that's an affectation (a claim/signifier), that's precisely why it isn't pretentious (it's sort of being critical of its own medium... and there are a lot of movies that can be self important about *film*... and yes, I know, it's a stage play but the point is that it's a movie about an actor so it could easily have been a movie about acting, when I really just see it as a film about an actor who might actually have had superpowers after all).

Then there are also Word of God interviews. Avengers: Endgame contains no signs whatsoever it thinks it's doing something important. If you put it in context with the Russo brothers' interviews about the film? Well, those interviews make some Big and utterly unjustifiable claims about the movie... thus retroactively making it pretentious.

The problems with pretentious as a means of referring to a film are therefore:

1. when it's asserted rather than concluded
2. when it's used purely as a response to the use of filmic techniques
3. when it's used purely as a response to the ideas of the film
4. when it's used a synonym for artsy (which is a separate critique... though it may run to criticism)

But if used properly, pretentious isn't a good thing for a film to be. Affecting the qualities of pretentious film-making is a bit meta but is not necessarily a means of avoiding ending up being pretentious anyway.

The instrumental pieces include spoilers. So what? Beyond super fans of the series, who is buying the instrumental soundtracks of anything?

This is something I go back and forth on. Cause I get you. Technically, they are still making more Tremors movies so of course it would seem like they care about them, right? I thought so too, even liked 5, 6, and the first 9/10s of the 7th despite them not being up to snuff. I was just happy to have more Tremors.

But then I read and researched more and started asking myself, wait, what? Why? I'd actually been operating off the assumption that Stampede *WAS* a part of the production on 5-7 and so relegated myself to believing that this is just what the creators wanted. So when I found out that not only was that not so, but those OG creators had made their own movie for 5 and Universal told them to fuck off. In more polite terms of course. And that was my line in the sand. It's one thing to keep making crap but to tell off the people who got you there in the first place is a dick move. And one that makes me think they ""hate"" Tremors. They use it for the money it can make, but to Universal, Tremors is this red-headed step-child that they would give up for adoption if it meant they could get a better kid in the trade.

>""Michael Gross did not like the new script. So what?

It's not just that he didn't like it, they forced it on him and then when he negotiated for ambiguity, they told him yes to his face only to turn around and cement his death with a needless montage. 

>""Universal went with a cheaper production company. So what?""

You're kinda making my point for Universal ""hating"" Tremors. If they cared, don't you think they'd want to give it the love-money it deserves?

>""The instrumental pieces include spoilers. So what? Beyond super fans of the series, who is buying the instrumental soundtracks of anything?""

Holy fucking yes I have tried. They have their walls higher than Pink. Did you not read the part where I've been emailing them and maybe, finally getting them to change the episode order around? Maybe. And that's because of one IT guy that I can tell likes Tremors too. 

>""It seems like you are publishing a lot of second hand information and that is not good enough to escape the biased opinion you clearly have.""

I am publishing every scrap of information I can find on this situation to specifically combat that bias. I found the numbers, the quotes, the who, what, where, why and how's.

"I liked the first couple Tremors movies, but this is a fairly simple question. What the hell is going on is that they don’t make enough money. You put Ted, Pitch Perfect, and Meet the Parents franchises in quotation marks like they aren’t actually franchises. But everyone one of those made more than the Tremors “franchise.” Also, you said “they are making it for an audience after all” and that’s not entirely true. They make movies to make money. If a movie gets a 0% rating but makes a profit, they couldn’t care less.","So you bring up an excellent point and one I have grappled with my own self. (The reason for the quotes of ""franchises"" is a double hate-joke from me on the entire idea of movies being ""franchises"" anyway. To me, they should allways be series. A franchise is McDonald's. The connotation skeeves me out.)

Tremors has made $514 million dollars and only $16 million of that came from the first movie. Which means almost $500 million of this series was made in direct-to-video sales. Do you have any idea how crazy that is? All of those you mentioned got theatrical releases that allways boost numbers but Tremors made all its money on the home market.

That's why I said the audience thing. If these movies were only making that much money while at the Box Office. Yeah. Sure. Arguments can be made on their merit. But that is money made directly from people saying they like these movies so much they'll bring them into their homes and keep them safe and warm forever. It's a strange thing indeed.

Cause what other series has made that much money off just DVD/VHS/streaming sales? They all *could* but Tremors has done all that dough underground and it still maintains.

"Tremors deserves better than SyFy. SyFy seems to have a huge issue with quality. They seem to prefer things to be outright shit and see if there's a pleasantly surprising fanbase. I've heard in regard to their movies like 'Sharknado', even if someone came to them with a smart, original, cheap & nuanced script, they'd likely turn it down. They don't wanna be surprised with having to meet expectations. Slow and steady may not win this race, but it keeps the ratings numbers high enough.",">""SyFy""

Talk about a single word that can make my skin crawl.

I remember when they switched it from The Sci-Fi Channel to The SyFy channel and that has allways marked the drop in quality for me. It was the moment they went from caring about good science fiction and the greatness that can come from it, and chose to focus on lowest common denominator crap (watching Eureka is sadly hilarious in this way because it shows exactly that shift. S01-S03 are from Sci-Fi and S04-S05 is SyFy and the series goes from knowing itself to juggling like crazy to keep itself afloat while an axe comes down from above. And I gotta credit Andrew Cosby and Jaime Paglia on that front for doing their absolute best to give that show a satisfying resolution. They had like 18 different series finales!) Kinda like what they did to The Expanse. Grab a property, put the minimum effort in, and scoop up the money that craps out until the goose dies so you can make Thanksgiving from it. 

The Sharknado thing is pretty close too.  [If you go to the Stampede Entertainment page](https://stampede-entertainment.com/site/fan-extras/tremors-faq/?include_category=tremors-5) and look up Tremors 5, there are so many people saying exactly this and throwing ideas at them that I can't be the only one to feel this way.

This is such a well made feel good movie. Too bad the director got burned out from Keira Knightley and decided to say adios to hollywood.,"> Carney attracted criticism in 2016 when he referred to Keira Knightley in an interview with the UK's independent newspaper, stating “I’ll never make a film with supermodels again.” Knightley, who has amassed multiple accolades throughout her career, including Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA and SAG Award nominations, worked with Carney on the film Begin Again, alongside Mark Ruffalo and Adam Levine. While Carney praised Ruffalo as a “fantastic” actor and Levine for not being “a bit scared of exposing himself on camera,” he said “Keira’s thing is to hide who you are and I don’t think you can be an actor and do that.” “I don’t want to rubbish Keira, but you know it’s hard being a film actor and it requires a certain level of honesty and self-analysis that I don’t think she’s ready for yet and I certainly don’t think she was ready for on that film,” Carney said. The director later issued an apology, which included the following 'I'm ashamed of myself that I could say such things and I’ve been trying to account for what they say about me. In trying to pick holes in my own work, I ended up blaming someone else. That's not only bad directing, that's shoddy behaviour, that I am not in any way proud of. It's arrogant and disrespectful'.[9][10]

"I think there's a very strong case to be made for the Middle Earth franchise for any number of reasons.

For one, its the only franchise that had been steered throughout by the same people, from the writer/producer/director and the production companies, through the DP and special-effects people down to the continuity supervisor, First AD and sound design team. Literally, the biggest changes in the crew across the six films were the executives, the gaffer and the stunt coordinator.

This gives those films a uniformity that is relatively rare in film franchises of this size: its a unified body of work - made by one director and one core creative team - as oppose to a lot of disparate entries being tied together.

I also think that it being a mere six films (and an upcoming TV series) makes it feel a bit more the ""boutique"" franchise as opposed to the double-digits of entries boasted by the MCU, Bond, Star Wars, and now the Wizarding World, too.

Certainly, the accolades are on its side, probably for these very reasons.","A big reason for that uniformity though is because it's really just two long movies split into three parts. I don't see it as being a franchise in the same sense as the MCU, Bond, Star Wars etc.

With other franchises I could start almost anywhere and the movie completely stands alone and gives you a full story.  I'm not going to watch The Two Towers though just on its own. I would have to watch the whole trilogy. So its very different in that respect.

"John carpenters 1982 ""The Thing"" its a classic You've probably had to recommended to you before. I watch it on the regular to try and figure out who's the thing at the end. 

Theory 1)McCready is human and Childs is thing. That's the general favorite theory that most people like. ""Because Kurt Russell is the hero""

Theory 2) McCready was the first victim to be consumed/imitated and the villain of the film.

Mac was in fact the first person to have contact with the thing""when they brought the carcass back from the Norwegian base."". Most people believe he's the hero at the end since we see the movie through his point of view.  but the film also makes a ton of sense if you think he's the first turned.

"I'm not sure about films, but Breaking Bad and especially Better Call Saul really stand out when it comes to this concept. They are just the best at getting you to realize something before you notice that they are trying to get you to realize something. That's the crux of it, being able to give your audience a message without them knowing that there is messaging. It's like the plot of Inception. Their goal is to make the target think they thought of something on their own. If a storyteller can achieve this one thing, they are already head and shoulders above the rest. I've seen so many technically impressive yet mediocre films and TV shows, that could have been great, if the creators simply had this ability, the soul of which is subtlety.

It doesn't have to be perfect, either. The audience will eventually realize they are attached to a leash, with the writers hand at the other end. What's important is that they don't see the leash, or feel the tug, until they've already seen what they were being lead to. Though, if you could lead your audience without them ever realizing it, even at the end, then you are indeed a master.",Well put. Better Call Saul is incredible in this regard for sure,movies
"Well written piece, i really love both movies. I think another example could be Se7en, especially how it shows the viewer some of the crime scenes but doesn't tell you or overindulge in the gore like a lesser horror/thriller might.

It also reflects the fact that the detectives are always catching up and never get to see the crime take place, so why should the audience.",Definitely a good example,movies

Ronin (1998) definitely doesn't hold the audience's hand as the story goes along. It figures that you're smart enough to figure out what's going on.,"Just watched it yesterday. Love it. The characters are actually pretty smart. Jean Reno follows De Niro by loyalty and friendship so he is a bit out of his element in the grand scheme of things,but he is quick on his feet and he has that street smart attitude.

De Niro is the smartest one obviously, but for the most part of the movie it's not explicetely told to the audience what he really is. Its shown rather than told. Same thing for Gregor who you at first think is just the techie guy but he was pretty intelligent as well, only his gamble with the sniper didn't pay off. I loved those characters and it's actually rare to have a duo completely in line with each other with basically no conflict between them, and its refreshing. 

Reno and De Niro don't even need to talk to understand each other during most scenes , they acknowledge what they have to do simply and in short sentences.",movies
"The most intelligent movies do not have street-level characters having dialog with university-level vocabulary and phrasing. That's just a writer showing off, and it never fails to take me out of the story in any movie that does this. Yes, it's brilliant dialog. Yes, it's well-written, but it's not believable for certain characters. It's even worse when high school student characters talk like this. 

If you're going to treat the audience with respect, you show people talking how real people talk. Not every character is going to be a Mensa genius discussing philosophy with other Nobel laureates. Writers can capture thoughts in beautiful eloquent prose because they have all day to sit at the keyboard and tweak every little phrasing. But in real life, people don't always know how to express what they mean even if it's a simple thought. Especially when there's stress and drama going on!

I loved The Sixth Sense because of this. Sometimes the characters said nothing at all. They just sat there staring. But you still got a sense of exactly how they were feeling. Other times they just bantered idly. It was brilliant. 

And Good Will Hunting did the opposite. The guy really was a Mensa genius, but he just talked street with his buddies and other characters he encountered. You never got the sense of the writers just showing off.

Anyway, over-written dialog is a pet peeve of mine. It's as awful as bad acting to ruin a movie for me.",On a related note. The amount of film characters with deep knowledge of philosophy and classical music is astounding. Some rando from the street just starts spewing out Nietzsche and their favourite movement of a concerto,movies

"Both are great films, but I wouldn't say that you could ever have a ""masterclass in treating your audience intelligently"", because the phrase makes no sense.

How much effort the audience needs to put in to figure it out is a stylistic choice, rather than anything to do with quality.

"> There’s... no misstep. He’s clearly done something like this before.

Except there clearly are missteps, and other characters frequently point out that he's clearly not prepared or equipped for what he's attempting.

Except they're not. They're wearing cheap, untailored clothes. They look like they got them at a thrift shop. That's the whole point. They're costumes, and not good costumes.

> They are Los Angeles through and through (or at least Jules is). They go into another side conversation about television Pilots and Jules explains what they are and how they work - it’s a conversation you’d hear in LA, but not in Milwaukee, for instance.

"I don't know... with all due respect, I disliked both pictures; not that anyone cares, but I have my reasons and in no way are they objective.  

No Country for Old Men felt like a strong (though slow) ascent with no adequate descent and finish, and Pulp Fiction was too much talk--intelligent as it was written--without corresponding action to match (or top) it toward a tremendous finale.  For both pictures, the closure paled in comparison to the buildup, which made them a let-down.  They felt like they were going somewhere interesting but ended up at a 7-11 for some Coors and Camel Lights.    

Don't mean to offend anyone, but that's my take. 

Cheers.",That’s like the politest oppositional take I’ve ever seen on Reddit,movies
Llewelyn Moss is not the main character in No Country for Old Men.  The story is about Ed Tom.,"While yes, I'd argue Moss is still a protagonist. Ed Tom is telling the story and waxing philosophically about the events (even more so in the novel), but the story itself happens to Moss. Ed Tom is more or less an observer who really doesn't want to get in the middle of everything.",movies
"I dunno man. Both of those examples you give don't really rely much on the audience having to pay close attention. Lewelyn basically narrates much of that scene where he finds the shootout left overs. And him having been in Nam isn't really relevant to the scene or his story in general. He's capable and we get that from that opening scene. Exactly how he's capable isn't really relevant.

Pulp Fiction like you say doesn't explicitly tell us everything. But it doesn't rely on the audience to pay close attention. The scene is written in a way that commands your attention which allows the various details you've listed to get across to the audience in a way that's both efficient and entertaining. It might not give us 4 but 2+2 isn't that hard. The trick is making 2+2 interesting for the audience. And that comes down to Tarrantino knowing his audience well.","Well my post is specifically about character backstory here (which most of the commenters seemed to ignore when blasting it lol). From a plot perspective, these two don’t really fall into that 2+2 style. For plot, it would be something more like The Invitation as an example",movies

"**Ex-Machina** (2014) - Sci-Fi/ Thriller. A  programmer at a massive internet company wins a contest to spend a week with the company’s founder at his remote getaway house. It’s soon after that the founder reveals that he has been attempting to develop artificial intelligence and wishes for the programmer to facilitate the ‘Turing test’ with the AI to see if it has been achieved. Tensions rise as the programmer begins to realize he may not be at the house by mere chance. 

I won’t spoil for those that haven’t seen it but it’s one of those movies where I was frustrated immediately after watching and as hours and days went by, the more fond of the film I became. Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander are absolutely incredible.

And for those keeping track: I have been watching at least one Philip Seymour Hoffman movie per week in 2021, hoping to finish his full-length catalogue by the end of the year. 

**Patch Adams** (1998) - Comedy/Drama. Semi-Biographical account of a doctor with an unorthodox approach to medicine. Robin Williams stars as the title character bringing an immense amount of charm, charisma, and heart to a pretty shaky screenplay and even shakier direction. 

Hoffman portrays Mitch Roman, Adams’s roommate. The character is a stark contrast to Williams’s bubbly and outside the box Adams. One of the most inspired scenes in the film is a disagreement between Adams and Roman stemming from >!Roman telling the Dean that Adams has been cheating!< . It’s a heavyweight matchup between two titans of the industry gone too soon. While Hoffman is a side character for most of the movie including his arc, this scene was absolutely his and I wish we could have seen the pair together more.","Had the opprtunity to meet the real “Patch Adams” in college. I was a big fan of the movie, and wanted to see if he was anything like Williams portrayed. Spent about an hour in his company, and he definitely was as bombastic as Williams portrays him to be. 

Pretty incredible looking back at Hoffman’s work that he was in this film. But, that’s what I loved him. You could find him excelling in movies like this one and “Along Came Polly” just as easily as say “The Master” or “Capote”...

"Week 2 of anime under the belt, with ***Wolf Children*** being my favorite.

* *Millennium Actress (2001) - 3/5*
* *5 Centimeters Per Second (2007) - 3.5/5*
* *Redline (2009) - 5/5*
* *Sword of the Stranger (2007) - 3/5*
* *Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (2000) - 4.5/5*
* *The Garden of Words (2013) - 4/5*
* ***Wolf Children (2012) - 5/5***

***Wolf Children*** was a great experience. It follows a single mother and her struggle to raise two children in the countryside. Obviously, the core issue is that her children are part wolf; she lacks the knowledge on how to raise them properly while also learning to live outside the city on her own, hiding the nature of her children from any neighbors. It sounds kind of bonkers and I've seen a lot of hate online that it's for ""furry lovers,"" but I feel like such claims really do a disservice the beautiful, heart-aching story of motherhood, familial love, humanity, coming of age, and acceptance being told here.

The animation is wonderful. The ""snow montage"" was breathtaking. There are several emotional beats that really hit hard, especially towards the end when the children face internal struggles of their hybrid nature, beginning to accept who they are and which part of themselves, human or wolf, they want to pursue. I loved this so much. I was in tears.

Some thoughts on the others.

* *Millennium Actress -* I love Kon's animation and editing so much, and the story here is rich with culture, but it felt a bit too dense for me and didn't land as well as his other works.
* *5 Centimeters Per Second -* Shinkai's animation is of another world; absolutely spectacular. It's a short, simple story told in 3 parts about love. I liked this.
* *Redline* \- It's *Death Race* meets *Fast and Furious*, with amazing hand-drawn animation. Over 100,000 drawings/frames, I believe? It's so over-the-top, doesn't have much narrative or character depth, but I came away in awe.
* *Sword of the Stranger -* I saw high praise for this on reddit last week, but I didn't think it was all too great. A cliched, predictable story that lacks depth and the fight scenes were not as mesmerizing as some comments made them out to be. Not bad, but not great.
* *Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust* \- A gothic thrill ride that balances its themes very well. I dug the animation, the story, the implied world building, the art style, and D as the lead character. The little epilogue at the end was so sad.
* *The Garden of Words* \- Again, it's worth reiterating how god damn beautiful and otherworldly Shinkai's animation/art style is. This is only 45 minutes long, but it told a lot of story in such a short amount of time. Extremely poetic with great pacing and a great ending.","Excellent choice, *Wolf Children* was fantastic! I was a little surprised you didn't take to *Millennium Actress*, but maybe the theme of a quixotic quest for a lost love just hit me harder. Thanks for giving it a shot!  

If you want another recommendation, you might enjoy *Night on the Galactic Railroad*. It's not as accessible as most of the other animes you've watched, delving deeply into religious and philosophical themes and surrealist imagery, but it's beautiful and heartfelt.",movies
"""Autumn sonata"" by Ingmar Bergman 

Bergman was a master at intelligent family dramas, and always managed to get great performances from his female actors. 

Both come to the forefront in this film, which dials back on the regular philosophy and abstraction to just focus on making a powerful narrative.

Liv ullman plays a shy, and insecure young woman with a lot of emotional baggage and trauma from her past which she struggles to deal with throughout the film. 

Ingrid Bergman plays her confident, and energetic mother, who dominates her surroundings with her powerful presence. Yet is callous and unloving to those around her.

The two reconnect after years of estrangement at their family home, and unsuccesfully attempt to keep their personal issues to themselves as the facade quickly drops away around them.

The film plays out as a duel of personalities. Ullman is initially docile towards her mother's infractions in the first half, as things are attempted to be kept quiet  between them. However, there is an unsettling fakeness and manipulation to both of their interactions as they try to get one up over the other with purposeful changes of clothing, cutting comments and muttered insults. This shifts explosively in the second half, where ullman finally lets loose and goes into one of the best monologues in cinema where she just utterly annihilates her mother and all the repressed anger and emotional neglect boils up into a powerful tirade of hatred and cruelty.

The film is extremely clever, and is worth watching just for the acting alone. Definitely a top 10 bergman film, and may even make it into the top 5, even with its relative simplicity","What a pleasure seeing somebody talking about Bergman, the goat 🐐. 

Autumn Sonata is remarkable. Which of his films is your favorite?",movies
"**Memories of Murder** 

I knew from people that this was going to be a film that rivaled Parasite in quality and it really did. The acting is superb (Kang-Ho Song becoming one of my favorite actors working today), the directing is basically perfect, the music is great when it kicks in and the cinematography is otherworldly. Just the way he frames shots and sets the tone with just that shot is absolutely astounding and he just keeps it at such a good pace. 

There were many other moments in this film where I was legitimately trying to figure out who it could be and I was on the edge of my seat every single time towards the end, which blew my mind since I knew so little about the film, to begin with. To make this his third film would make any other director their and yet Bong Joon Ho continues to outclass himself every new movie I've seen from him. In terms of beating Parasite in terms of quality, I honestly can't tell you. Both are so good and I'll probably switch it up daily. 10/10. I can't wait to watch The Host. Also, the chase scene in the film is perfect and I will make sure everyone knows that.

Other great films I've watched this week.

**Batman: Mask of The Phantasm -** Honestly,  did not expect this film to have such melancholy to it. Love the action in this. 8/10.

**The Iron Giant -** I guess I have been proven wrong that Vin Diesel peaked with The Pacifier. The animation still outclasses a good amount of things today. Simply astounding. Wish there was more 50s parody commercials though. 8/10.","Re: “Memories of Murder:”

"**The Red Shoes** (1948) - Going in, I knew only that this was on a lot of ""greatest"" lists, and that I'd already been wowed by Moira Shearer's ethereal dancing in *The Tales of Hoffmann* (1951), which was similarly brought about by the directorial dynamic duo of Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell (The Archers). This film is about the drama and politics inside a ballet company working to put on a new production based on Hans Christian Andersen's fable about a woman who is forced to dance by a pair of red shoes until her feet are cut off. The framing story's inside look at the behind-the-scenes frenzy and horribly complex logistics to put on a flawless performance reminded me most strongly of movies about the heyday of the Circus (namely Cecil B. DeMille's Oscar-winning potboiler *The Greatest Show on Earth* (1952)).  

The main theme here is the tyranny of Art, how it seduces and devours in the service of birthing an extraordinary experience that rises above the base, grubby lives of ordinary people. Ballet company master Lermontov (Adolf Wohlbrück), sees potential greatness in untried dancer Vicky Page (Moira Shearer). Like the fanatical high priest of a bloody religion, he makes no denial that he will sacrifice anything and anyone in pursuit of the elusive transcendence of humanity that is great art. Relentlessly, he drives Vicky to ever-more-extreme greatness as she, exulting in the same siren song, is inexorably drawn back to him. However, the pull of her passion for her Art against her desire for ordinary human love inevitably threaten to rip her in two, and she finds herself facing a terrible choice.  

The central showpiece is a performance of the titular ballet, which starts with normal staging but ends up in an extra-dimensional dream world. I can see why this was considered controversial by ballet purists on release, but I think augmenting the performance for the film was a legitimate benefit. The directors knew the bulk of the audience would not be accustomed to the artistic shorthand of staged dance, and used the hallucinatory imagery not only to represent Vicky's torment, but her ascension and transformation, and as a visual manifestation of the grace and genius of the dance.  

Besides the eye-popping color of the remastered print, one of the things that made this movie such a treat was recognizing the breathtaking physical prowess of the professional dancers who made up the cast. There are plenty of terrific ballet movies out there (such as the heartwarming *Billy Elliot*), but watching performers at the peak of their craft, who have spent practically every waking moment of their adult lives training their bodies to Olympic levels of athleticism took this one to a whole new level, and really brought home to me why the characters were so passionate about their art.  

As a minor side-note, I found it extremely interesting to see a British movie made in 1948 which featured several clearly gay characters. It made me wonder if it was considered more ""tolerable"" by a conservative society to show this openly because the film takes place in an artistic realm, and artists were already assumed to stand ""off-center"" of societal norms due to the nature of creative genius. At any rate, it made this film feel surprisingly more progressive and modern than I expected.  

The ending felt a bit shoehorned-in, IMO, but it wrapped up and elaborated on the overarching themes so I can see why the directors chose it. This is a beautiful work of great Art about great Art, and definitely worth experiencing at least once.  

Excellent honorable mentions: *Funny Face* (1957), *The Silence* (1998), *Lady Bird* (2017), *Dukhtar* (2014), *Chak De! India* (2007)","The red shoes is fantastic, and is unusual in being a film, about the making of a play, in which the film follows the structure of the play.",movies

"**Game Night** 2018

I had way too much fun watching this movie. Going in, I had heard pretty good thing about it, but it may have been one of the funnier movies I have seen in a while. I think the real start of this was Rachel McAdams. I don't think I've seen her in a comedy like this before. Everything just clicked to me. Jason Bateman was great in another performance while wearing a button up tucked into khakis.","Hahaha at Bateman’s description! You’re absolutely right! 😂🤣😂

McAdams uses that megawatt smile and charm to perfection in this film. Shout out also to ‘Meth Damon,’ himself: Jesse Plemons. He absolutely slayed in his role... Plus, for “Friday Night Lights” (TV Show) fans, you get a reunion between Coach Taylor (Kyle Chandler) & Landry (Plemons).",movies

Saint Maud (2019) - Psychological Horror. One of the best recent horror movies. Rose Glass is a very exciting director and this being her feature film debut is a sign of very good things to come. The whole film leaves you wondering what's going on while allowing you to build your own opinion. I may be a bit bias towards this film as I've spoke to Rose a few times and she is honestly one of the nicest people within the industry but anybody who has seen this film has asked me to pass on messages to her on just how good it is. Truly amazing film made by an amazing person.,And what a fucking ending,movies
"Coming 2 America - really enjoyed this far more than I thought, having seen the original countless times. Eddie Murphy and the whole cast really anchored the comedy with enough endearing sincerity to make everything. The costumes and set design was really fantastic, something I didn't expect for a sequel to a 33 year old film. 

Top Secret! - this was on my watchlist for a long time and it didn't disappoint. I don't think its exactly on par with the ZAZ's other masterpieces (Airplane! and the Naked Gun Trilogy), but so much of the gags are insanely hilarious. I was really struck by how by young and dedicated Val Kilmer was in his feature debut. Never missing a beat throughout. 

Perfect way to spend a Saturday laughing.","I’m a big fan of “Top Secret.” While maybe not as funny as airplane or naked gun, there was some great craftsmanship to how they filmed some of the scenes. The “backwards” library scene and the underwater bar scene come to mind.

Plus, Kilmer was fantastic! Didn’t realize at first he actually was the one singing all the songs. Should have known since he did the singing in “The Doors,” as Jim Morrison.

"*King of New York* (1990) It was in this film that we first really got to see Christopher Walken being the Christopher Walken we've come to know and love. In *King of New York* he's got those amazing monologues he is now known for, he is dancing one minute then unloading a gun and laughing the next, it's all pure Walken gold in this film. But that's not all. You also get a young Lawrence Fishburne - Larry at the time - as Walken's chief lieutenant of his drug empire and then there's David Caruso and Wesley Snipes as two cops willing to break the law to bring down Walken. What more could you want?

Basically, *King of New York* is a gangster film that hits all the notes perfectly, it's filled to the brim with action and beautiful women, and all of this is done with the brilliant cinematography of Bojan Bazelli making it all look simply gorgeous.",My favorite Christopher Walken,movies
"- **Finding Nemo (2003) - 8.5**

- Minari (2020) - 8.5

- Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 (2017) - 8.0

- Rurouni Kenshin Part III: The Legend Ends (2014) - 7.5

- Throne of Blood (1957) - 7.0

**Finding Nemo** - I've seen this movie many times as a kid, but it was always the Dutch dub and it's been many years. This is the first time I saw the original dub, and it's amazing. The voice acting is so good and all the animals have so much character. The animation has obviously aged quite a bit, but it still has some really pretty visuals. Definitely one of my favourite Pixar films. 

**Minari** - This movie looks so pretty. The locations they filmed this are beautiful and the cinematography is great. The acting is fantastic, especially by Steven Yeun. It's also just really... cute? Just the right amount of drama. I do wish the ending was a bit longer, though. Like, maybe they could have done a little epilogue or something. Show me how those lovely people are faring! 

**Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2** - Lots of emotion, humour, beautiful visuals, and fanfastic use of music. Also one of the few memorable scores in the MCU imo. So far in my full MCU rewatch (release order), this is my favourite movie.","That kenshin series was fucking great... i didnt (and still dont know) what it even is?? A manga?? A cartoon??... but i could tell it was a live action movie of something...
I really like it... well done... not quite as good as 13 samurai.... but on its way ;)

Still very pleased with Edward Norton as the Leper King lol and saw a lot of familiar faces (too many to count) 10/10!<

"Yeah, they really are brilliant.

Part 2 still has one of my favourite movie endings, with pacino reflecting on the family that he lost, and where it all went wrong","I was struck by the flashback scene - Vito's bday, where Michael tells everyone he's enlisted in the Marines and Sonny chastises him for it. The whole movie I was thinking 'what is Michael's problem with Tom?' and then you get to that scene, with Tom saying he's had many conversations about Michael's future with Vito, then Michael says 'my future...' or something like that. Obviously, that's not the source of all of Michael's shittiness toward Tom, but it really shed new light on their whole relationship.",movies
Completely agree and shared the same experience with the first paragraph....I did enjoy the trilogy but not to the level that it had been hyped to me all along. I will say I love The Godfather 2 but as a fan of Mafia media I can’t say it hit me with the same level I was expecting. I’ll give it a rewatch at some point with the hope that knowing what I’m getting into will give me fresh eyes,"Watching Part 2 (the early Vito sections) as just a story about America and what it meant to come here and carve out a life for yourself/your family really blew me away this time. It's a very different movie from the first, but in all the right ways. Makes me wish the third film would have followed the same structure and shown the time between the end of the 2nd movie and the beginning of the first.",movies
"I agree.  They really get better with each rewatch. 

I got the Blu ray set a few months ago and watched them all, then watched them with Commentary and then watched them all again ending with the new cut of Part 3.

"Now try the ""Godfather Epic"" which is a 7 hour version that puts it in chronological order",I was thinking I'd give this a shot sometime soon. How much would you say it changes the experience?,movies
">there’s something so woefully, painfully human (and American) about the story

Yeah, theft and murder are so very human enterprises...

Like, I get the original *The Godfather*: its the story of a man tragically ***reduced to*** a life of crime. That's a very compelling premise.

But even in that film, Michael settles on the road to bloodshed much too quickly and abruptly, and we spend way too much time with Vito. But still, good movie.

Then comes *Part 2*, along with virtually every other crime drama made since then - *Once Upon a Time in America*, *Goodfellas*, *The Sopranos*, *Irishman* \- and expects me to invest in its depraved characters.

Nope. No thank you. Its wild to me that, in any other film of any other genre, audiences will deride the main characters for being ""annoying"", ""mary sue/gary stu"" or whatever, but a crime-drama where the main characters are thieves, murderers, and sociopaths is somehow considered riveting cinema.","Yeah theft and murder are very human enterprises. Personally I don’t think a likeable main character is necessary many of the best movies of all time follow pretty morally messed up people like A Clockwork Orange, Apocalypse Now and like you say most gangster movies. The movie is just making stuff less morally clear that’s a good thing the world isn’t black and white and movies can reflect that. 

If you don’t like Vito as a person that is fine he’s not meant to be some completely moral person it’s just in contrast to Michael it’s supposed to show how far violence and crime will bring people down even if their initial motives aren’t completely evil. It’s part 2 of The Godfather, the themes from the first movie are meant to continue into the second so the tragic fall is continued in the second.",movies

C. Yeah, some people could just do their own research and work to understand movies. But if someone asks me, I will give them so much information that they'll wish they hadn't asked.

So yeah. Creators, explain away.","I think the problem is a creator explaining themselves frequently *does* prevent people from forming their own opinion.  Our culture treats authorial intentions as if they're gospel. I like an author who has something to say about their work, but it's really easy for them to poison the conversation by saying too much.

If you're looking to understand a work of art, you'll find a way towards that understanding whether or not the author gives comment. The fact is we all come to ""art"" on our own terms anyway. If we don't have the background/life experience to digest a particular work of art, an author telling you what they were going for isn't going to help you understand.  

It's the difference between watching Big Chill in your early twenties because it was directed by one of the guys who wrote *Empire Strikes Back,* and then again in your late thirties when you've grown ideologically distant from old friends and have no idea why.

"I've been scared to watch it again. I saw it opening weekend when I was 15. I was blown away by how awesome it was.

They really based it off the original series. So yes there was sexual tension between West and Judy. A straight guy would joke to Heather Graham that they should repopulate this planet. 

The Dr. Smith relationship with the teen boy was always cringey.

What would you do with a criminal when you're stranded with him? That's a good point. in the original series, he was always almost getting them all killed.","It really just came off very creepy from my perspective and I didn't care for either of their performances. I understand the importance of repopulation but also have to wonder how smart it would be to actually have more children when youre actively lost in space.   


Anyone who tried to kill my family would be getting jettisoned into space. Not worth the limited resources and attention to keep them alive. It just seemed silly to keep someone who actively tried to murder them alive especially after seeing his spider form.",movies

"I haven’t watched the movie, but I did enjoy the reboot. It’s absolutely gorgeous, and the acting and characterizations are some of its strongest points (except for Dr. Smith, who I feel is the weakest part of the show, especially in season one). 

But overall, it’s a fun space adventure show about a family trying to overcome various obstacles through made-up scientific solutions.",I am excited. I started the old one this morning and am going to watch it fully before I start on the reboot. Glad that it's better than the movie lol.,movies

That’s part of the charm when going back and watching them now. It was moving to see Kat break down like that and make herself so vulnerable.

"I haven't seen very many of his movies tbh, but I don't see anyone here talking about his Leonidas in 300.

It worked for me in Den of Thieves.,He’s eating or smoking in every scene where he talks. I think it helps mask it.,movies
did you watch phantom of the opera,His performance in Phantom of the Opera is mostly hurt by the fact that he can't sing and that it's a bad movie. Other than that I think it's more of a Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor situation where it's a bizarre interpretation of a beloved character.,movies
"His performance in 300 is utterly ridiculous in the right way. I don't know if I've ever seen an actor chew scenery like that before. He went full ham and I love it. I don't know if I'd call it good acting, but it's certainly entertaining.",They originally wanted him to growl/whisper his lines and he had to convince the Zach Snyder that was fucking stupid.

"He is good, period - with the right material.

Gerard Butler hasn't kept his Scottish accent in years. Ask most Scottish people.,"Yeah, he's been in Hollywood for so long now his real accent sounds like someone trying a Scottish accent.

Sorry just had to vent. I did enjoy the film but it really pushed my buttons on people doing stupid shit.

Edit - Butler was a fantastic Phantom of the Opera.",Greenland is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life.,movies
I kinda gave up on him after the one he guards jaime foxx. I think he got typecast as an action star after one good outing in 300 but it just wasnt his thing. Im glad he's doing well in dramas.,"> after the one he guards jaime foxx

Law Abiding Citizen? Honestly, it's one of Butler's best films. It's just ruined by the final ten minutes giving Foxx's character an undeserved happy ending.",movies

"Gerard Butler is great! This also applies to many actors.

I love Charlie Hunnam but his American accent is terrible. It’s like he forgets he’s supposed to be American half way through filming (can sometimes hear it on SOA too).

Hugh Grant is like the only actor who gets to keep his accent no matter what film he’s doing.","True talent is just getting bored and dropping the accent halfway through a movie.

"Honestly the accent in Greenland sounded off, his Scottish accent had merged completely with an American one. Which to be honest, makes his accent truly authentic considering he lives there and most likely would pick up nuances in what he hears. 

If you watch Reign of Fire, you'll see his old proper Scottish accent.

And, his acting is almost as bad as his accent.","I watched it recently and we commented on how un-Scottish his accent is. It's like Scottish to please America. Although, I would expect a Scot to do a better Irish accent than he did. Atrocious!",movies
Also his name is an anagram of retard bugler.,haha,movies
"When we put Greenland on a couple of weeks ago, both me and my wife (she's Scottish, we live in Scotland) were apprehensive simply because Gerard Butler with an American accent is excruciating.

Previously, the only performances of his I enjoyed were Creedy in Reign of Fire and Stoic in How to Train your Dragon. Every other time we've seen him, he's been forcing a really terrible, generic American accent.

Him simply speaking with a Scottish accent stopped him from being a negative distraction and we ultimately enjoyed the movie a lot more for it.",People here are saying it's supposed to be a blend of American and Scot.,movies

One of those people that could've become as much of a superstar as one can be these days, but... didn't. Got the looks, got the acting talent, the charm, just not good with choosing projects.

Butler is just a yes man. You show action movie to him and throw around some money and he is going all Bruce Willis at it. Well... not all Bruce Willis I'd imagine. I saw some movie on tv where Willis was skateboarding naked around the neighborhood, so he just doesn't give the slightest fuck anymore. Which I kind of admire too.",movies
I love his films. Den of Thieves is my favorite.,That's an odd one because they basically remade Heat which is the best heist movie of all time so by rights Den of Thieves should suck but it was really entertaining.,movies

Just a dude with an accent and ""haha oh yeah Scotland L O L"", then move along with the story. 

Felt natural. I liked it. 

I've never known a Scottish father to go that far to chase after his wife n kid though. That bit is weird. Typically they'd shrug it off, get a cold bottle of irn Bru and blame it all on the UK gov.",I like the casual stereotypical xenophobia in your comment.

He didnt even try to do Egyptian in gods of egypt. First time ive seen a Scottish egyptian,Sean Connery was a Scottish/Egyptian hybrid in Highlander.,movies
Yup. Watched Rock n Rolla and Bounty Hunter on back to back nights. Don’t see bounty hunter.,RockNRolla will always be one of my favourite films. Maybe my no.1. Utterly love it.,movies
"Not totally in keeping with your ""accent"" theory, but Butler's energy in Den of Thieves was incredible. I could watch a whole franchise just about that guy. 

Fun movie with some gritty action, but it did slow down a bit whenever Butler wasn't on screen (the bank heist scene was dope though -- really terrifying).","I think he excels when it is his project.

There is a movie with him where he plays a retired soccer coach who reconnects with his family. Makes me cry everytime he’s so good in it.

I don't understand why actors like Butler and Worthington  are made to drop their accents when they've never been good at it. Just let their character be Scottish or Australian. It also doesn't need to be explained why a foreigner would be living in the states.

The editing of those final minutes, the idea that every piece of art you make (racing being Speed’s art) is a product of every moment, every experience, that’s you’ve ever had, to bring you to that point. It’s simply terrific. It’s impossible not to get chills. My favorite moment is the overhead shot where it shifts into full surrealism, where the racetrack melts around Speed’s car as he drives by.

"I don't think there's a literal answer to whether or not he is dreaming, because I think it defeats the purpose of the ending. It seems that Cobb is choosing to live in this ""reality"" whether or not it is real or in his head, because he finally has what he's wanted for so long. Just my opinion, obviously.",What he wanted for so long was to get back to his real orphaned children. If he'd been fine with dream versions then he'd have stepped out onto that beach where his wife was still alive too.,movies
">I interpret the message as trusting in your life, and not overly questioning what you know to be true.

"Wasn't the Top, his wife's totem? Thought he was checking to see if he was in her dream?","He was using the top as his totem which he should not be doing. Cobb broke a lot of rules setup for his team which is part of the reason he was so messed up

He knows his wife is dead so he would not worry about being in her dream.",movies
"He’s definitely in the real world.

He explains why in his last conversation with Mal.

He was never able to duplicate Mal exactly so he finally had to admit that she wasn’t real because she lacked details. 

Throughout the movie those lack of details are even worse for his kids. So the moment he sees his kids he knows completely and immediately they are real and no longer feels the paranoia.

Now it is possible that Nolan is doing a deep cut and Cobbs dreams become so lifelike he can’t tell, but the story does not progress that way and it would be a ridiculously horrible ending.",BEST ANSWER,movies
"Another piece. What if his kids aren't even real? Remember, he said himself that they were down there for what seemed to be a lifetime.

Certainly not confronting his guilt with Mal as that scene ends with him *emphatically rejecting* the notion of choosing to accept a dream as reality. 

So at the end he walks out to meet his kids because he's totally convinced those are his real kids. What about the spinning top? He was never using that as a totem.

For a (dark) comedic deconstructionist take on the genre, I recommend The Kid Detective.","I would definitely consider the Maltese Falcon noir— I actually took a film noir class and that was one of the key films we studied.

"I've seen over 50 Noirs at this point, more if you consider European ones. Out of the ones I've seen these are the best.

-Wilder's Ace in the Hole, Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity. 

-In a Lonely Place (Bogart's finest performance, his best noir)

- Films with Welles: The Third Man and Touch of Evil. Not too fond of Lady from Shanghai, though it's better than Gilda (likely Hayworth's more famous performance). 

- Revisionist Noirs/Modern Noirs: Chinatown, the Long Goodbye (the best Chandler).

- I prefer Lancaster's noir output to that of Bogart. The Killers, Sweet Smell of Success, Criss-cross and Sorry, Wrong Number (with the greatest noir actress, Barbara Stanwyck) are top tier, and he eats up the screen. 

Not a fan of Fritz Lang's American output.

Raoul Walsh has done a few key films, but his films often lack a gut punch ending. 

Mitchum's Night of the Hunter is aces, but not a fan of Out of the past and his other Noirs. 

Ida Lupino was in a few key noir films, and she directed the pretty great Hitch-hiker. 

Other flawed, but interesting ones are Femme Fatale by DePalma, Shock Corridor by Fuller (it's barely a noir though) and so on. Can provide more if interested.",">the Long Goodbye (the best Chandler).

"For any English-only speakers who enjoy foreign-language films, I highly recommend picking one you've already seen once or twice and watching it without subtitles.

You'd be surprised at how much more depth you find in cinematography and performances when all you're focused on is that, and not on intently understanding every line of dialogue. I haven't done that with any of Mads' films yet, but I'll definitely rewatch *Jagten* like that sometime soon","This is good advice!

When he entered the Charlie Countryman, I was like “fuuuccckkk...” He makes such an awesome villain. When he shows up at the wake and almost stabs Charlie with a broken wine glass calling him a faggot, perfect energy brought to that scene. Especially his facial expression when Gabi fires the gun at him. Fuckin top notch bud.

People have a tendency to want to believe people about anything plausible nowadays when it comes to ""evil"" acts, particularly when its an innocent child making a claim of being sexually abused. If the scenario sounds remotely plausible people start looking for blood.

"There is actually a ton of great information and speculation in this article that's worth the read for anyone interested in the topic of the future of theaters and the state of streaming.  Here's just a few of the sections I thought were interesting (and I highlighted some takeaways):
  
>These numbers are slightly less than the $3M Friday and $9M-$10M we were hearing about, and they’re **definitely less than the $14.1M that Warner Bros’ same day HBO Max release of Tom & Jerry posted last weekend.** Raya‘s opening weekend is **also less than Croods: A New Age‘s 3-day opening over its Thanksgiving stretch, which posted $9.7M.** And that’s definitely because **Disney did not reach a deal with No. 3 chain Cinemark, as we first told you (thus, losing around 250 bookings), Harkins, and Canada’s Cineplex.**      
    
>**Disney CEO Bob Chapek’s recent remarks** Monday at a virtual investment conference hosted by Morgan Stanley in which he said things like, **“The consumer is probably more impatient than they’ve ever been before,”** and that given how **the pandemic has brought a number of movies into the home, he’s not sure “there’s going back”** to the way business was done prior. **Even though Chapek said, “We certainly don’t want to do anything like cut the legs off a theatrical exhibition run,” many are concerned all of this is code for Disney moving forward with their theatrical day and date Disney+ model, and that Black Widow may emulate the same distribution path as Raya on May 7.**  

    

>What’s scaring many about Raya is that **Disney gets to keep 100% of whatever they’re making from the $30 Disney+ PVOD purchase of Raya.** Disney doesn’t have to split that PVOD revenue with any exhibitor. It was explained to me that **Raya‘s $30 price point on Disney+ is roughly equivalent to the rental that Disney would get from five or six movie tickets.** Wow. While I’ve heard Warner Bros. has been a partner with exhibition, and has made a deal on terms for their same day HBO Max titles. Disney hasn’t budged.  
  
>Disney didn’t burn down the house to keep warm back then, and I still don’t think they will now. **Currently, the studio says that Black Widow is still going theatrical on May 7, and exhibition hasn’t heard otherwise.** They’re just very suspicious, since there weren’t any trailers for the Marvel movie on Raya this past weekend, only those for Disney’s May 28 theatrical release Cruella. 

>From a sheer box office optics point of view, one can argue that Disney left money on the table with Raya by boxing out Cinemark and Canada’s Cineplex. Why would you do that with a film like Raya, that has an A CinemaScore, is 95% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and fantastic PostTrak audience exits of 93%, with an 80% recommend from the general crowd?

>Only Disney knows the answer to that question. **When it comes to the potential non-reporting of Disney+ Raya PVOD figures, no news is good news. For anything greater would throw the motion picture distribution model off its axis.**  
  
A lot of this to me says that the writing is on the wall that you can't put the genie back in the bottle now.  If Disney really is earning 5-6x off a rental versus a ticket, I suspect this dual-release may be come the norm down the line, or at least a *much* shorter theatrical ~~window~~ lead time, like 2-4 weeks potentially.    
  
It really all comes down to what those streaming numbers actually look like.  $30 is a LOT for a single film.  And you can't beat a theatrical experience for things like Marvel movies but is that enough?  If it were announced that Black Widow were going for the dual release, I can say that I would pay the $30 to see it at home now simply due to COVID.  If this were any other year though?  It's a toss up for me personally.","If they're truly making 5-6x the money per one rental I think the genie is long out of the bottle. Obviously that depends on how well some of these movies do but for bigger ones I don't think it'll be a problem.  

I think the problems come when you have something like Mulan that is clearly not at all worth the $30 tag to most consumers. How do you choose which release gets say a $20 tag and which gets a $30",movies

Why was Soul free but this isn’t?

They've had a total sample size of 2- one free and one premium. Now they have a 3rd piece of data to add to the list. They have 2 critically acclaimed films out and 1 critically mediocre (and GA panned). If people are willing to pay the $30 for premium, then they want to see what a good movie with get them vs a shit movie, etc. Sans pandemic, all of them would have been theater releases. So they're taking advantage of this newfound market to see what people are willing to do.",movies
"$30 to watch the movie at home on release-day might be golden for a family with kids, but it's absolutely horrible for single adults. I've been looking forward to this movie for months, but as soon as I saw that $30 price tag on Disney+, I went straight to torrenting it.

Feels to me like a failed service when I pay a monthly subscription but still have to download their content illegally. And if I have to start downloading every new Disney-release because they cost $30, what's the point of having a subscription? Might as well cancel it and go back to downloading.

Corporate greed is what pushes consumers towards torrenting.",I’ll just wait for it to be free.,movies
"As a single user of disney+ i would have gladly paid 15-20$ to see it (theater ticket is 5$ where I live). 30$ is simply too much in my opinion, i could get a great game for this much which will last longer.","$22 for a ticket where I live (minus the popcorn etc), I don’t have any particular interest in this movie, but if it’s something I do want to watch it’s a pretty good deal for my partner and I.",movies
"Taking a risk to make this Premier Access for a movie that wasn't even hyped up until last month probably wasn't going to look good.

One bit that stuck out to me was that it was starring mice because of Disney's association with Mickey. They wanted to keep making cute mice throughout the different eras (which explains Rescuers, too) and this was just meant to be one chapter of that.

I think that plan got a little bit squished when Don Bluth intentionally released ""Secret of Nimh"" (also starring mice) on the same date as Mouse Detective (specifically as a nice F-you to Disney) and it outperformed Detective at the Box Office.

I think there was a little bit of shame about that, and it made cute cartoon mice less of a Disney-specific thing. (And later there was ""An American Tale,"" too.

- Warrior, when 'About Today' from The National kicks in at the end and drowns out all the other sounds...

- Call me by your name, the ending monologue from the dad","Hey, separate thought, but if you liked Love Actually (me too), check out Pirate Radio by the same director (but don't watch any trailers! They spoil what's much better as a surprise!)

It's about a time in England's history (the 60s) when rock was not played on mainstream radio, as the stations playing it were not legal (mostly because of their commercial policies but this movie romanticizes it being about rock vs ""the man"" lol). So they literally had ships at sea in international waters broadcasting. During a time of some of the greatest hits of rock and roll history. (So it has an *amazing* soundtrack.)

It was released in the UK as The Boat That Rocked and was more than 2.5 hours. They cut it down for the North American release (Pirate Radio) and I think that was the right choice as the characters are more lovable this way (you can watch deleted scenes on the DVD).

And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry. And the truth is, I feel so fucking sad. And the truth is, I’ve felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I’ve been pretending I’m OK, just to get along, just for, I don’t know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own.

Richard Pryor already had Eddie beat here in terms of paving the way. These are also just terrible examples. Denzel was already famous in the 80's and he's a completely different kind of actor. Will Smith was a rapper before he was a sitcom star. I guess you could maybe make an argument for Snipes, but they are totally different too.

Revisionist history at its finest.  I guess you never heard of Sidney Poitier.,"I think OP probably should have left out the part about black actors not getting lead roles before Eddie.

Sidney Poitier did more for black actors and earlier than anybody, agreed completely.

Eddie's run IS extremely important in Black cinema history, For not only showing how big of a star a black actor could be internationally, but he was able to do action movies, romantic comedies, fantasy type stuff like the Golden Child. He sort of crossed over into a rock star level fame at his peak. And he certainly paved the way for guys like Will Smith, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle.",movies

"Historically speaking, Eddie Murphy is *extremely* important for not just black actors but for *comedians* also.  He really set the bar high for sketch comedy on SNL, and then he really shined in stand-up comedy while making the transition to huge comedy classics. One of the most impressive things about Eddie's box office is that it wasn't big-budget action movies helping to sell tickets, it was all on the back of Eddie's star power and the expectations of his comedy.   This was most obvious in him releasing a stand-up comedy special in theaters and it making over 50 million.

Also, Coming to America is really the first movie with an almost all black-cast to be that big internationally (300 million worldwide gross).  And this was a romantic comedy.

On top of all of that, Eddie was pretty big in introducing a lot of young comedians to the movies.  He put Damon Wayans in Beverly Hills Cop,  had Keen Ivory Wayans help him with Raw, Chris Rock in Beverly Hills Cop 2, Martin Lawrence in Boomerang, and Dave Chappelle in the Nutty Professor.

As impressive as Will Smith's box office was, he established himself in big budget special effects movies where he would play characters that *obviously* were laced with the smart-ass Eddie Murphy slant from the 80s.  Will Smith in ID4 and Men in Black basically mimicked Eddie's style of comedy to great success. 

Samuel L Jackson is 100% not a bigger box office draw than Eddie, he's just made more movies and appeared in a lot of huge franchises like Marvel and Star Wars.   Eddie's been in almost nothing but starring roles for 35 years.","Absolutely right! Thank you for spelling it out so well too. 

There’s gonna be a lot of contrarian redditors here but this is just undeniable imho. The biggest comedian today is probably Kevin Hart. He’s probably the biggest one since Dane Cook. 

But even that ain’t got shit on Eddie Murphy in his prime. This guy had a charting billboard hit, box office smashes, multiple tonight show appearances, back when that meant something, and a legendary run on SNL. 

He was the anti-garret",movies
"People in this thread are throwing out older Black actors to counter OP’s post, but are missing the point about international reach. Sure, Pryor and Poitier were big stars before Eddie Murphy, but their fame isn’t as global as Murphy’s. Murphy could be successful almost anywhere in the world, but I can’t imagine Pryor and Poitier having the same impact outside of the U.S.

Edit: When I say impact, I don’t mean that the other performers are irrelevant outside of the U.S.. I mean that their “brand” isn’t as big as Murphy’s outside of the U.S.. Poitier, Cosby, and Pryor were never the face of an $100 Million dollar film, whereas Murphy has been on more than one occasion. Whether you like Murphy’s work, or think it’s better than the Pryor, Cosby, or Poitiers is a different conversation.","Except they did and so did Bill Cosby

"I would absolutely make that point. His career and later Will Smith, Jackie Chan, and Dwayne Johnson's are examples of how bullshit some Hollywood elites views on POC actors not being draws worldwide was and still are.","There was a story years ago when Will Smith got the role of Hitch in the movie Hitch that the studio did not want to pair him with a white actress because they didn't want to market a movie with a black actor dating a white lead, but then they also didn't want to cast a black actress as the love interest so they settled on a Hispanic actress in Eva Mendes who was both cheap because she was just starting to gain some fame and a black guy dating a light skin Hispanic woman is a little better to market in their eyes.

"**Mallrats**

Not a fan of the director's cut, and prefer the theatrical, but it's still worth a watch.  The theatrical cut entirely removes a subplot around Jeremy London's character accidentally causing a terrorist incident at a Governor's ball that is the direct reason Michael Rooker hates him through the film...  The Extended/Director's cut puts this sub-plot back in the film. 

There are multiple scenes through the film referencing this happening through the film that had to be changed, or outright dropped to get what we see in the theatrical. Only one line refencing the Governor's ball plot survived into the theatrical cut... Just before the gameshow Rooker's bosses vaguely reference the incident at the ball, but nothing more is elaborated on.   

What's worse is that the directors cut actually removes a nice reference to Clerks and the interconnectivity of the Askewneverse.  The reason Jermey London's girlfriend appears on the game show.  In the theatrical version she appears because London tells the girl that was supposed to appear that ""Cameras make you look fat"".  Thusly that girl has a brain aneurism while exercising in a pool... This is the same girl that Dante and Randall skip out from work to attend their funeral in Clerks which, chronologically, takes place the day after Mallrats.  In the extended/director's cut, that tie-in to Clerks is absent...   between that, and the 20 minutes of bloat that the Governor's ball adds to the film, I would say that the Theatrical is still the best version of the film.","The first time I ever watch the directors cut, I was so confused the first 20 mins.",movies

There are films I watched when I was younger that I didn't love at first, but I rewatched and loved them when I was a bit older probably since certain films require a little maturity to fully appreciate.",movies
"I watched it recently for the first time and had the opposite reaction: I loved it. I think the main reason was the character of Michael, who I'm surprised you didn't find interesting. 

He's initially portrayed as a straight laced college kid war hero, parading around in his military uniform at the wedding and saying he's not like his family. As the movie progresses he's slowly roped into a life of crime. But what makes it good is that he isn't really fundamentally changing as a person, as its clear he was always cool, calculating and built for a life of crime. Instead it feels like a facade is being pulled away to reveal what was there all along. 

This is captured really well in Pacino's performance, for example the intensity in his monologue where he says he'll kill solozzo and the cop. It's also done through clever and subtle characterisation. For example when the bakers boy is struggling to light a cigarette after he and Michael scare potential assassins away from the hospital with Vito in because his hands are trembling from fear, and Michael takes the lighter from him and lights it for him, his hands remaining completely steady. 

The movie also cleverly contrasts Vito and Michael. Vito says at the beginning ""we are not murderers"", yet by the end Michael has become more ruthless than his father ever was, and for arguably the wrong reasons. This is explored further in part 2. 

Also I disagree there were many wasted scenes. Even those that you could argue drag on a bit, like the wedding scene, show the contrast between the shadowy underbelly of crime in Vitos office, and the sunny and regal exterior. I felt like every scene had a purpose. My only major complaint is Michaels relationshio with the Italian chick felt tacked on and superficial. 

But overall, I feel like the movie is basically just a character study of Michael, and a very good one. The movie is also just really well crafted in pretty much every technical aspect.",I think the Italian girl subplot is just to show what an utter bastard Michael is deep down. dropping his American girlfriend and immediately marrying an Italian (purely based of physical attraction and the want to have an italian wife who would better fit in with him in the godfather role) then pretending it never happened once she died and marrying her. Its hard to see any goodness in him after a while compared to Vito who remains fair and at least somewhat decent/honourable until his death.,movies

It might not look like such a big deal now because so many of the stylistic and written flourishes became part of the cinematic lexicon, and were copied ad infinitum.

Personally, in Europe, I remember when everyone was going on about the TV series ‘The Killing’ and how it re-wrote the rules on Crime Drama. I didn’t watch it at the time, but caught up with it about ten years later.

My first reaction was, “what’s the big deal?” I mean, it was good and all but it just looked like a hundred other similar shows that were doing the rounds.

"I hope for an ending that’s built to. I don’t generally like for the ending of a film to just toss in a last minute surprise to either be happy or sad. 

An example of a happy ending I didn’t like would be War of the Worlds. I understand that it’s the original ending, and can’t blame Spielberg or the writers for following through with that, but the film is such a bleak trip that it feels cheap to have everyone be okay. Conversely, I hate that Remember Me uses the Twin Towers to throw in a cheaply emotional stinger for the ending because it’s just manipulative, shallow, and again, cheap. 

The Impossible is a film about a family separated by a tsunami, and it ends obviously with them reuniting. It’s as predictable as can be, but while it may be more realistic or “subversive” for them to not be reunited, you’re spending the entire movie watching them strive for that singular goal, so for it not to happen would be cheating since the rest of the film is building up to it.

It isn't Christopher Nolan at his best. It's Christopher Nolan at his most.,"It’s essentially him when he doesn’t have anyone to pin him down as a storyteller to focus on story over plot. 

He conjured a weak story so that he could wrap it around muddled and underdeveloped plot, which in turn was wrapped around his filmmaking fetishes atm. 

There’s nothing wrong with approaching filmmaking based on your fetishes (I’m not talking sexual for anyone with an unclean mind lol), many other great directors do the same. Indiana Jones films, especially the first were usually built around the stunts/action sequences Spielberg or Lucas or whoever thought of. 

He obviously saw Tenet as a chance to play around with forward and reverse moving image, coupled with some stunts like climbing the building in India. Or the car chase etc. The real plane crashing into the hangar.

The only problem is that it’s superficially impressive, but it’s not meaningful because the story was just too weak. Though we may have enough in the plot by the end to understand after a few viewings, it just lacks anything to make us care about the characters. 

Personally, if Pattinson’s character was so integral as he seemed, I’d much rather the film centred around him. The signals of his importance are there but they don’t mean much when we barely see him unless it’s for exposition, action scene or in a montage. 

We need a moment when the characters can be human beings, not plot explainers or montage pawns. He’d fallen close to that trap in many films but this time he went full tilt.

"Could I make an argument for Tenet being closer to Primer than Inception?

I agree that Tenet is lacking in character connection and relatability, even compared to the simple relationships in Primer. I don't want to seem like some kind of contrarian who likes the film for the exact reasons everyone else dislikes it, but personally I don't think a deep connection to human characters is necessary to enjoy a film.

If the concept holds enough water, I fully support the idea that the movie is worth making and worth watching without characters deeper than ""spec ops guy is confused and wants to save world, hot lady loves son, bad man doesn't give a shit about anyone.""

The concept within The Protag's world is so advanced beyond him, and every other character, that they barely matter. Half a dozen pawns on a board the size of Asia.

Again, in probably talking out of my ass, I'm not even close to a high-art film guy.

"Inception even seems cold compared to Interstellar. Interstellar is nailed beyond belief. Tenet is like the coldest movie ever. It was all concept. I could give a shit about anybody in it. It felt like the movie took place in a vacuum, void of any human relationships. No bueno","I feel inception did it best. The father son story, wife and husband and the longing to get back to your kids all worked amazing.
Put in some feeling of actual danger (with a twist) and it just worked so well.

The scene where he opens the safe while things explode and people fight is one of my favorite scenes ever. Amazing music, Great acting and the strongest catharsis you could wish for - finding out after his death that your father did value being with you after all.(with a twist...)",movies

"I enjoy most nolan films first time I watch them and appreciate them more and more with each subsequent rewatch.

I did not experience this with Tenet.",Agreed. Very disappointing.,movies
The end of Inception makes me cry every time.  I was really emotionally invested in Cobb and him being reunited with his children.  I felt nothing for the main protagonist and only a very brief moment for Pattinson's character at the end.  I also think the lack of emotion is what soured me on the movie overall.  I don't give a shit about the main character at all because he gives out the vibe that he doesn't give a shit about anything.,"That's the problem I have with the Protagonist. Am I suppose to not care about him? All of Nolan's main characters have been extremely charismatic. I don't know if it's the Protagonist himself, or the actor's acting or his lack of charisma that made me not care. It's very rare for me to not care for the main character in a Nolan movie, being one of his biggest fans. Like most people, I cared about Neil and teared up in the end, which makes me wonder if the movie would've been better if it was based on Neil instead.",movies
"Nolan didn’t want an emotional investment in Tenet. This is why the main character has no name, and is referred to as, “the protagonist”","That might be so, but I can't figure out what the purpose of doing that would be.

Sure, there are movies out there that are purposefully detached and devoid of character, but there's a functional reason for it that enhances the experience or themes of those films. It's not necessarily inherently bad to make a film that way, but there generally needs to be a good reason for it, especially because it's something we normally expect in your average film (having some emotional connection and warmth to the characters).

In the case of Tenet, I just struggle to see why he would purposefully make it so cold and distant. That approach doesn't really have anything to do with any sort of theme or ideas integral to the story or moral as far as I can tell... if anything it seems at odds with the intent for us to care about the female lead and her emotional attachment to her son (*case in point, I can't remember either of their names...*). And ""The Protagonist"" seems to go out of his way as a cold-blooded agent to try and protect them, developing more emotional investment than he has at the beginning of the film, not less...

But it all just feels like a bunch of barely developed relationships and blank faces that are just there to hang this wild sci-fi concept on. Like I don't even remember seeing more than a glimpse or two of the son we're supposed to feel that this mother loves and wants to save. I know we saw him outside the school for a sec but there was no development that would even help me remember his name or face or why the mother cares about him beyond some equation like ""mother+son=caring"".

In Inception there was an *actual reason* we couldn't see his Leo's childrens' faces until the end. It's exactly that sort of dream logic we've all experienced where you're trying to get someone's attention and they keep walking away or something. He can't get back to them until he completes the plot of the film. Then when he finally got to them at the end there was an emotional release. So at least there was a reason to not develop them much as characters. In Tenet however, it just felt like Nolan was too busy constructing the next big set piece to be bothered with showing us how this mother relates to her son, or why The Protagonist cares about this woman beyond completing the job. They're just mechanical plot devices.

I suppppose you could reach and make some argument that this time inversion thing is deconstructing The Protagonist's perception of the world and making it seems so mechanical, and thus he doesn't see people's emotions the way he used to, but there's literally no attention or development of an idea like that ,so I'm not giving any extra credit for it. It just feels like it was ignored so we can fly to another exotic location to do another heist.

Beyond that, with Inception, I feel like even though that movie was also based around a crazy sci-fi concept, it's foundation was built on a more relatable experience. We've all had dreams and can relate to some of these concepts of being able to control parts of the dream but not others, experiencing what seems like days or week in a dream in only a few hours, waking up but realizing you're still in a dream, getting jerked awake when we fall in our dream, etc. So even though it's taken to another level in the movie we have some built-in emotional response to those situations and how it makes the characters feel.

However with Tenet, the concept of time inversion is just so foreign and mind-bending to us, and so outside of any sort of relatable experience, that the whole premise just feels a lot more distant and mechanical and it's much harder to put ourselves in the characters' shoes. That just puts the movie already way behind in terms of getting us to care about the characters. If anything this movie needed even *more* attention to character development than Inception.",movies
That's because Tenet is not a character story like Inception is.,"Are there any stories which are not character stories?

I remember hearing a writer rant about this (it might have been Neil Gaiman, or John August) about how they hated this idea of “character driven” as it implies there is such a thing as “non-character” stories. After reading their mini-essay, it changes the way I approach writing.

Their stance was, every story is fundamentally a character story. We don’t read listless descriptions of events, we see how they affect the characters. 
Actors don’t pick up scripts and say “this character is bland and uninteresting, I can’t wait to play them”, they may bring something unexpected to a role, but there was already a character that interested them to begin with.

Obviously some stories are more emotional than others, a heist film will probably be less concerned with the characters personal life than a romantic comedy, but both equally character driven.",movies
"I actually like how unattached tenet feels - I think that’s supposed to be a part of it. I mean we never learn the main character’s name, he’s always just called the protagonist. Makes you really believe that what happens in the movie is just a training sim for the protagonist so that he can become his later life self. Maybe setting up for a sequel idk","There are countless films that use an emotionally detached no-named protagonist and still make you *feel something* about the film through their actions, or empathetic supporting characters. IMO all the fancy effects and plot twists count for nothing if you're not emotionally invested or engaged in anything that's happening. If complete detachment is what you want just watch a Michael Bay film.",movies
"There's a point to Tenet's lack of emotions, somewhat similarly to Dunkirk. Inception is also character-driven, while Tenet is ""idea-driven"".",I had so much more investment in the characters in Dunkirk. Their situation is so universal and understandable that I didn't need a huge set up to know who they were and why they were acting the way they were. Nolan can get away with thin characterization when he makes their situation clear and cinematically readable.,movies
"I thought I was alone in the Tenet is MEH zone.

I just could not give a shit about who did what to who and how.. It's like a fun game reduced to sterile instructions written by a lawyer.","Forget the uninteresting characters or the poorly laid out ""rules"" of the world we're witnessing, at the end of the day Tenet was **boring**. A films greatest sin.",movies
"I rarely do repeated watchings of movies, but I did four within a short time of Tenet.

Loved it.

I didn't realize that the Protagonist largely delivers an emotionally mute performance until reading about folks' reactions here. For me, the character's lack of emotional expression gave me a canvas to project my own emotions onto. It was super gripping for me, and I was frequently on the edge of my seat thinking, ""What is he thinking right now?!"" because it felt he was as stunned or clueless as the audience trying to figure out what is going on.","I like Tenet a lot, I legitimately don’t understand the hate. Someone else in this thread said the reviews of the movie were bolstered since it was the only film in theater, essentially. I saw it the other way, I watched it then read reviews and thought they were giving it hilariously low ratings.",movies
"It feels like something that isn't be said but, Tenet just wasn't that good. There's plenty of movies with good concepts but poor execution and this is one of them. Poor sound, no emotional connection

Nolan takes big swings and I love him for it... Aside from maybe Miyazaki I can't think of a single director without a miss.",I’d say PTA has no misses too,movies
"Nolan has gone on record stating that he intentionally made it like this on purpose, he wanted it to feel like a Bond film. In Bond there really isn't much character development either, it's slick, all business and gets the job done. He intentionally didn't give the protagonist a real name as it goes with the motif of a secret government agent. 
Nolan knows what he is doing and can write emotional characters if he wants to. 
Would I have liked if there was an emotional connection like Inception? Sure, probably but he intentionally decided to go down a different route and I still think it's an amazing film. People need to zoom out, forget this is Nolan and look at the film overall, imagine being able to create a film like this.
It might not be everyone's cup of tea but by no means should it be considered a bad film","If Nolan ever said there isn't character development in Bond, then he's dead wrong.",movies
"I feel like the reveal that Pattinson and Washington are going through time in different directions, that they’ve actually known each other for years and that Pattinson is only going to know Washington less and less as time goes forward (I think I got that right) was supposed to be the most emotional moment.

But all I could think about is how much better Steven Moffat did it in Doctor Who with River Song. In order to be emotional we have to know the fact that they’re going in different directions right from the beginning and then witness the relationship going from one end to the heartbreaking other end where the person who knew the most about the protagonist ends up not recognising them at all.

It can’t be emotional for us if it’s just a quick reveal at the end. It has to be developed as the focus of the whole movie or even better as recurring story peppered over several years of content.","> Pattinson is only going to know Washington less and less as time goes forward (I think I got that right)

Somewhat. That was the end of Pattinson's journey (see the camera pan to the backpack), so he was time traveling in a non-linear fashion and jumping around",movies
"Tenet wasn't the best movie. But seeing it in the cinema. Having no sound problems, hearing all the dialogue, and it been the last movie I saw before lockdown2.0 ... I thoroughly enjoyed the shit out of the experience and would easily watch a Tenet 2 if it could replicate the kind of experience I had watching the first.

The unemotional part I found quite refreshing. Everyone was professional and too the point (bar the stupid mY chILd line). The only way Kenneth Branagh's character could have been more evil would have to have broken the fourth wall and reminded us all he directed the Artemis Fowl movie. 

I kind of absolutely loved John David Washington as this completely blank professional and competent agent. There was no fat, no chaff and no wasted time. He felt like like a real professional. Robert Pattinson meshing with him, with [spoiler] knowing in hindsight he was a long term friend that knew the protagonist far better than he knew him it all made sense [spoiler]. 

Aaron Taylor-Johnson just randomly appearing and again getting straight down to business ... again awesome. No ""oh high im major Ives I lost my wife to reverse entropy, i trained hard and work my position, this is my justice, my backstory"" he was just a professional commander of the elite force. I loved how he just meshed straight into the plan.

In reality, the world they inhabit is completely unrealistic. Everyone is cool, stylish and professional. There is no inefficiency, no waste, no slack. Everyone pulls their own perfectly. But this is completely unrealistic. However Nolan taking us there for a couple hours was a fucking trip. Much enjoyed.

But yeah, it's not going to teach you about your self or emotions.","I chuckled so hard at the Kenneth Branagh Artemis Fowl comment, oh man. Full agree though, this was a great cinematic experience. So many questions as it's unravelling and I felt like on the first watch through I understood most of it, just not the tiny specific details with the time inversion mechanic. 

I thought the emotional beat at the end with TP and Neil was also good, I felt really sad and I thought it was really interesting to tell a story in a way that you don't even get to see it but understand it. Tenet was super experimental, I ended up really enjoying it. I'm surprised that people are panning it so hard just because it lacks emotion, I am so willing to overlook that for the rest of what Tenet brought to the table. Not every film needs to be a great character study, I thought each character getting down to business was great, absolutely finding your comments hilarious on ""i lost my wife to reverse entropy"" damn",movies
"i think it was intentional. the protagonist even has no name. i think he was meant to be us, the audience. except from him, all the other supporting characters were compelling and very interesting.","I thought I read that Nolan wanted to make a film where character/character development had no impact on the plot - or something like that. Every single character was a single dimensional trope.  The ""protagonist"" the battered wife, the villan... None of them had any depth. 

I think it was an interesting experiment. A failed experiment. But I suspect it's going to make future Nolan projects even better ... Or much, much worse.",movies
"I think that was sort of the point wasn't it? Isn't the protagonist actually named protagonist in the credits? That's pretty on the nose about what was intended. He has no personality, nothing for the audience to relate to. I took it as Nolan purposely tying one hand behind his back (no main character) and seeing if he could still tell an engaging story. I saw a youtube video that argued that anyways, and it made a convincing case that that's what Nolan was going for.

Didn't really land for me either, but it's cool that the guy is constantly trying new stuff.","If we are not meant to care about him at all, trying to include the love story was not a good choice.",movies

Maybe I haven’t got to all the comments about it not making sense but I think the level of discussion in what I’ve read so far is pretty good. 

It’s easy to forgive a plot for being nonsensical when you are invested in the characters (see Endgame), but in this case where the characters are blanks the plot becomes everything, and it becomes even more apparent and irritating (for me) that it doesn’t make sense. I love Inception but I’m sure that if the characters were as absent as they are in Tenet I would be scrutinising the mechanics of the plot much more closely and possibly realising that it doesn’t hang together.",movies

"That was 100% the main problem for me with this film.

And that’s fine! But he seems to have taken the criticisms throw at him and it just makes Tenet bad. I had no interest in the Protagonist and his feelings toward he had toward Kat felt fake. It’s a shame because Washington is a very charismatic actor!

You have Cobb learning to forgive himself in order to allow himself to be with his children at the end and you have revelation that the incepted guy, despite clever spy like plot, really only cared about his distand father loving him.

Tenet is the new last Jedi. This is going to be exhausting to defend,"I don't think the comparison really works, and I like Last Jedi.

I mean, Nolan making films that come off as cold and distant isn't some new critique, at this point it's basically a trope that he loves big-budget high concept storytelling but often struggles (or refuses) to define an emotional core.

Whether this is all intentional, or simply a reflection of how he writes characters and directs his actors isn't something anyone here can know. All I do know is that the first and last time in ages I'd been properly invested in an actor's performance in a Nolan film was McConaughey, and I'm still not entirely sure that was by design.",movies

"Saw IV is the worst one, hands down. 1-3 is the og. After that, the original writer (he also played Adam), left and other people tried to keep it going. Having saw IV take place at the same time as III, made it very implausible and silly. V had some decent moments but wasn't great either. VI was actually refreshingly decent. VII was forced fan service, which somewhat worked if you're a huge fan. Jigsaw was actually good (as good as you can get after several cash grab sequels). I've been looking forward to Spiral, and I really do hope it's good, since it's something Chris rock actually wanted to make and put his own money towards, as opposed to a studio sanctioned, quick buck sequel.

"I think Red Letter Media did a pretty good re:view on this film.  It was very badly received when it was first released but because it appeals to people on two levels it developed a cult following.  On the surface it's a shallow action movie, and people can and do enjoy it for that reason alone.  

If you take a closer look you notice it resembles a WWII era propaganda film.  I watched a couple American Army training films on YouTube and they have a similar vibe: ""Let me show you how easy this is.""  Of course the setting is different, but not just the sci-fi element, the society is different.  

There is no democracy, to vote you must have served in the armed forces.  The first thing we see the children being taught in school is that their government is the best because it understands the fundamental reality of life, violence=power.  In this universe moving political speeches or the free exchange of ideas mean nothing.  What matters is how hard you hit.  

And what kind of society does that leave you with.  The film *says* that its great, and everybody is happy and prosperous.  But the film *shows* the reality.  Every citizen has been mangled and crippled. Some are missing limbs, some have been blinded, no one survives without serious trauma.  In the end all of the adults are killed and those lovable kids who signed up less than 2 hours ago get neatly slotted into those new vacancies.  

Here is the real truth of the film.  In this world humans exist only as cogs of a machine.  When they are used up and worn out they get replaced by newer parts and the machine just keeps running. Humanity is gone, wiped out completely but not by the bugs, by us.

In what way was the book fascist? If you do choose to answer me, please include your own definition of *fascism* so we can ensure we're on the same page for a discussion.

It's always amazing to me how differently /r/Movies and /r/Books feel about the **book** Staship Troopers. I've encountered several Movies posters who decried the book, then admitted they haven't read it but assumed the book was just a serious depiction of the movie.",movies
"Well, since you live in Europe you might be interested to know the original book by Robert Heinlein - which the movie more or less follows - was based on the novel *All Quiet on the Western Front*, by Erich Maria Remarque, which tells about WWI from the perspective of a young German soldier (drawing from his own experiences as an 18-year-old German soldier during that war).

So, the culture of military propaganda depicted in Starship Troopers had its roots in Germany, although it certainly incorporated some Cold War American culture too.

The most disappointing part of the movie to me was the ""happy ending"" - being already familiar with Remarque's novel I was waiting for the big reveal underscoring the futility of war, but instead it was ""Yay!  We won!  And we're all happy and alive!""  To me, that undercut all of the satire built up in the movie to that point.","I think the ending fits just right with the rest of the film.

I strongly recommend you familiarize yourself with Heinlein, his career and his works before making a claim that ""he didn't like American democracy"".

Not only was he an American naval officer, but he wrote several books about what different political spectrums would look like in their own perfect, ideal world.

"It is a fascist movie about a fascist government written and directed by people who have fascist sympathies. Robert Heinlein was a fascist in real life. 

No, you are not smarter because you call it a ""satire."" There is nothing to satirize in the movie.",">It is a fascist movie about a fascist government written and directed by people who have fascist sympathies.

The director, Paul Verhoeven, grew up in Nazi-occupied Holland. He recounts how close his parents came to being killed during the war, and the images of brutality he witnessed as a child.

> Robert Heinlein was a fascist in real life. 

Robert Heinlein was an American naval officer. He went on to write *Stranger in a Strange Land* which is about free-love hippies, and *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* which is about hardline libertarianism. Unless you're going to assert that he was simultaneously a fascist, a free-love hippie, and a libertarian I do not see how you drew this conclusion.

"I would say so, yes. It came off as rather lazy writing to me. The events of the film are similar in their execution to something like “Lucy” where the base premise is best on something that *doesn’t work the way the film presents it.* 

It also sort of reminded me of the “Law and Order SVU” multi-part episode with the guy who kidnaps Olivia. The way they present his trial, is dramatic for the sake of it, and presents the law in ways that are a little too silly and over the top, that a cynical person might nod their head and say “That’s the US law system for ya!”

However, I think the biggest issue stems from the fact that the film clearly *does* try to justify itself. Human rights don’t get legally stripped away from someone quite as easily as the film insists they do. They also don’t get defaulted to some random ass caseworker over their children every time. Nor would said caseworker be allowed to take on so many cases, or would the lawyer’s argument that the main character was committing acts of abuse so easily be glossed over. It’s all justified, of course, by having a buffoon judge who is willing to state out loud that he isn’t impartial, by having him refuse to allow a witness because he “knows them.”

I’m sure that maybe something in one I said above goes a little deeper than I said, but Jesus. That’s a lot of pieces that have to fit together to make that nonsense work. By the end, it’s apparently continued to work to the degree where she’s a national celebrity for...taking care of old people? Her business is nationally traded...somehow?

I think out of all the Spieberg/Williams collaborations, Hook may be the biggest mismatch between the quality of film and the quality of score.

Don't get me wrong, I love Hook. I was definitely in the target audience demographic when it came out in 1991. I love that today if I'm at a party and I start a chant of ""Rufio... Rufio... Rufio... RU-FI..."", EVERYONE my age will complete it with ""Oooooooooohh...."". Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman give very memorable performances, as do many of the younger cast.

However, the film is one that you really have to be a kid to fully enjoy. Watching it as an adult today, I can see why Spielberg wasn't happy with the final product. As another poster here said, it's uneven. There are some great elements, and I like his modern take on the Lost Boys and Neverland, but the whole thing never really comes together as a cohesive whole the way Spielberg's classics do.

But that score, man... It's one of John Williams' finest works. It's grand and emotional and full of adventure. There are so many great themes. ""You Are the Pan"" and ""Farewell Neverland"" are some of the best tracks Williams has ever laid down and, in my opinion, easily stand on their own as simply beautiful music. On top of that, you can hear the orchestrations and styles that Williams would later use to great effect in the Harry Potter films. In a lot of ways, the score to Hook is a kind of prototype for the early Harry Potter scores (as is the score to Home Alone).

It isn't one of Spielberg's finest, but Hook will always have a special place in my heart.",movies
"After Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T. etc. Hook was a little bit of a let down. It just didn’t have that Spielberg magic really.

That being said, it’s grown on my over the years for sure. I still don’t LOVE the film but I do like it.","True, but I’d take Hook over Ready Player One or BFG anyday.",movies

"Hook blows, but on the positive side, Speilberg never half-assed visual effects after that.

"This is going to date me pretty badly (*\*cough\*old fart\*cough\**) but the very first movie Ron Howard directed, the 1977 masterpiece *Grand Theft Auto*.  Note: It has absolutely no relationship to the popular video game series...!

The movie, as mentioned, was Ron Howard's theatrical directorial debut and he also starred in it.  The movie's plot was... meager.  Ron Howard's character loves Nancy Morgan's rich girl.  Her family hates poor Ron Howard and wants Morgan to go out with creepy rich boy...

The bottom line is the two lovebirds run away to get hitched and rich family offers reward to stop them and *a lot* of car crashes ensue.

...ah, forget the plot...!

In 1977 you had *Smokey and the Bandit* which, along with this forgotten little film called *Star Wars*, were the two biggest box office draws and producer Roger Corman decided to exploit both genres, releasing both cheesy car crash/chase films and cheesy sci-fi films in their wake.

Anyway, being a really young kid at the time and loving *Smokey and the Bandit*, I absolutely loved *GTA* and the wall to wall to *wall* crashes.

But when I got the DVD many years later and sat down to re-watch it... wow, how boring!  Not quite the comedic masterpiece young me thought it was and after a while the car crashes, frankly, grew tiresome.

Ah well!

[Grand Theft Auto \[Official Trailer\] 1977 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUM82uBey90)","Growing up in the poor life of the 70's mum couldn't afford to take us to many films. In-fact, Bed Knobs & Broomsticks was the first family visit to the cinema in 75. A re-run. Soon enough Star Wars came along and I begged her to see it. I didn't know then that my mum had to work double shifts to pay for the tickets for us all. Next in line was Hooper, as I said, then The Bees. All the school children waving off those bees was cinema to me. Then, she wanted to take us to a film that she wanted to see. A Dr. Zhivago re-run. We were 10 years old. She said it was the worst experience in a cinema she ever had. Us farting and mucking about totally took her out of the film. Not forgetting the annoyance we were to the rest of the audience. Even to this day, I tell my mum, ""why did you take three ten-year-olds to see a 3-hour film set in Russia about world war 1?"" She always replies ""Because it's a beautiful film.""",movies

You're very clearly supposed to believe that most people died before anyone figured anything about the creatures out. Considering how long it took science to figure out the Coronavirus, it's not exactly that weird of a conceit and happens in any post apocalyptic monster movie.

Do you really have to suspend disbelief that a government would be woefully unprepared for an alien invasion that hunts on sound? If these creatures arrived during Trump's administration, he'd be blaming it on ANTIFA and immigrants while saying deaths would be close to 0 soon.","If those monsters/aliens showed up in real life and the government instructed everyone to be quiet, there would be millions of people who would purposefully be loud to own the libs or some shit.",movies

"Meh. There are even more holes than that, as I recall. Not a lot of the science holds up to close scrutiny.

But I think my takeaway was that the 'science' aspects were really just a backdrop to the overall theme of the thing which was really about, I dunno, mindfulness, and discipline, and focusing on building a safe space for your family in a dangerous world. If you give up some of that quiet peace and move into a noisy area to stay safe you're sacrificing something that's actually worth fighting for. I guess.

I'm not sure I agree with all that, but I think the theme kinda drove the science here, not the other way around. I mean, I liked it as I remember and thought it was pretty sharp but it's definitely got logic holes you can drive trucks through.",This. A hundred times this.

Think about that for a minute. Wow what a massive force of unsustainable invaders....

And they don’t die out IMMEDIATELY afterwards? Seems confusing since they are clearly ravenous beyond any reason and consumed by a need to feed. 

They ate everything in a matter of days essentially... I imagine this means the propagation rate is insane too unless we are to believe hundreds of millions of these unable to think about anything else came to earth in a hoard. 

They would by that logic die out in catastrophic numbers the day after all that meat sources disappeared. 

Movies where monsters from space destroy EVERYTHING super fast and then maintain dominance just doesn’t work if their not methodical and intelligent. 

But that’s just my take.",But we only followed story of one family living alone. We didn't see whats happening around the world. Maybe there are some countries who found a way to kill them. Maybe lots of people are living in ships and islands. Maybe governments also took refuge to some island or some secret underground base.

My problem with the movie was - are you seriously going to tell me no one ever sneezed? Cleared their throat? Coughed? Farted? We make noises all day long. There's no way a family could live without making any sound for any length of time.,I'm sure they did all that but were lucky enough that no monster heard it.

"I’m going to be straight up honest, I didn’t really like it very much. That being said, when it ended I gave it a 4/10 and was so blown away by how bad most of the reviews were. I mean I’m seeing 1 and 2 out of 10 all over the place. It wasn’t my cup of tea, but I found it just meh. I’m curious why everyone else found it to be the worst thing ever lol.","I think timing was crucial there. On one hand, the criticisms of Vance’s misrepresentation of Appalachia and sort of overindulging in the stereotypes of what people assume Appalachia folks to be like. 

The second thing in regards to timing is that it came out four days after Joe Biden was declared the victor of the 2020 election. For the prior four years, there had been a general assumption that “hillbillies” made up a key piece of Donald Trump’s base voters, and that these folk were rather gleeful to see “liberals” and “city folk” and “the elite” suffer in a way not unlike how they suffered. This despite the fact that there was a rush of films and shows designed to try to appeal to/explain the existence of Trump voters. 

And there’s a third thing: in the US, there’s definitely an undercurrent of contempt towards poor people and “white trash” types. 

So, in the post-election euphoria for many in realizing that Trump lost, the idea that here was *another* film to sympathize with these people who clearly had no interest in sympathizing with anyone else was too much to bear. Even if and especially if they hadn’t watched the film.",movies
"Same reason [Dave Chappelle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dave_chappelle_sticks_and_stones) has that much ballyhooed 35%/99% split on his latest comedy special; audiences love spiting those ""liberal elitist critics"".","I trust audience reviews even less than I trust the academy to decide worthy oscar winners.

Random people have no experience being objective or properly critical in their analysis of media. Critics make a profession out of it. They know contrairianism is a gimmick and not a very practical one, but audiences will fight to neutralize analysis they don't agree with.

Audiences will complain that reviewers leave the scores they do to push an agenda, and then go ahead and do exactly that. It's stupid and hypocritical.",movies
I’d say it’s one of those “book is better than the movie” scenarios.,"I've read a lot of bad things about the book, too. It's not surprising that an adaptation would receive similar criticism, since a lot of criticism has to do with the characters, story, and especially the message.",movies

"Not to pile onto what others here have said, but yeah, if you limit yourself to films made strictly after 2000 you're going to miss out on some superb stuff, such as 1973's The Wicker Man (without which there's no Midsommar), 1963's The Servant (without which there's no Parasite), 1961's Last Year At Marienbad (one of the most unnerving films I've ever seen, with nary a jump scare in sight) or almost all the best work of Davids Lynch and Cronenberg (Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Videodrome, Dead Ringers, Crash etc).

">In Endgame, the women in the MCU coming together in the climax

That scene was so in your face and cringey I grimaced.

But generally speaking the more people can identify with the characters on screen the broader your market appeal is. So it pays to have more diversity in film.","Why can people nowadays only identify with people of the same ethnicity, gender, etc as themselves? Have we lost our ability to identify with fellow humans by dint of being human?",movies
"It depends, but for the most part no. Representation can have a huge impact on people who rarely see their kind represented positively in the media. 

Here's a clip of Diego Luna on [Ellen](https://youtu.be/HIAUAoPxPiY?t=166) talking about being in a Star Wars movie. From the way he is expressing himself, you could see, not just the enthusiasm, but the awareness and deep appreciation of being part of something iconic like Star Wars. Even he knows that Star Wars doesn't feature a whole lot of Latinos in their movies. 

But it's not always a positive thing. The worst example of representation I've seen is in Beauty and the Beast. Oh, the controversy it generated. The headlines read: *Beauty and the Beast to Feature a Gay Character.* As a gay man myself, I thought: Awesome! But then I saw the film, and I was just so offended by it. That film didn't feature a gay character. It featured a joke. 

I read that Sony was planning on making an all male follow up their their all female Ghostbusters that was going to finish it with a third film featuring the male and female cast but plans fell through because of the blowback the film received. Personally, I don't think it's a big deal to see female led films like Ghostbusters or Oceans 8. Intent matters and these films were really just made at the wrong time. There's just so much resistance against SJW to the point that anything that resembles it is branded and banished from the opposition. Pollical correctness is just not always the case with these types of films. I think we should at least give it a chance before we write it off. The Ghostbusters reboot failed before it was given a chance, and I don't even think it was a bad movie. 

So, to answer your question: It depends. Sometimes it's genuine and other times it isn't.","Yeah a lot of people confused some of the stars rising to the bait pf twitter trolls for the Ghost busters movie trying to be ""woke"". The reality is it was the studio trying to catch the wave of female lead comedies that started off with Bridesmaids.",movies
">In Endgame, the women in the MCU coming together in the climax is very on the nose, and seems like a frail attempt by Disney of addressing representation. 

This is your example of Disney trying to force representation? The cringey ""all the gals together"" moment?","Lmfao yeah, but mainly because the way this scene is shoehorned in  is a particularly in your face way of doing this but trying to play it off",movies

Can’t believe they passed on Ant Man and the Wasp again :/,"I bet as soon as there's a Half in the Bag about it, it'll be picked up by Criterion.",movies
Criterion is great but I'd rather have 4K releases.,It kind of blows my mind that Criterion are still behind in making 4K releases since they are one of the most prestigious home media distribution companies of important and classic films. You'd think they would jump at the chance since 4K releases are becoming more in demand. Arrow and Shout Factory have started to capitalize on the demand for 4K masters before Criterion and are starting to pump out 4K releases on a more regular basis.,movies

It’s fairly accurate. There are some artistic liberties to make it more dramatic - like Beane firing head scout Grady after an altercation (in reality Grady was on my board with the moneyball philosophy and left on good terms to become AGM of the Texas Rangers.

"Sorkin makes a lot of things palatable to people who aren't enthusiastic about the subject, but sometimes they need a hook. Brad Pitt is definitely a hook. 

Steve Jobs, on the other hand, is a tough sell. I think it's every bit as good as Moneyball, but I haven't recommended it to anyone in real life who didn't immediately express their disinterest in watching a Steve Jobs movie. Fassbender is a great actor, but he doesn't have that Brad Pitt hook quality.

Don't mean to ignore Steven Zaillian as a Moneyball co-screenwriter, but it definitely fits the Sorkin wheelhouse of Sports/Broadcast/Politics... all things I don't want to watch a movie about until I see who wrote it.","> Steve Jobs, on the other hand, is a tough sell.

Not for me. If there was a channel that showed nothing by Moneyball and Steve Jobs alternating 24 hours a day, I'd be watching it. Two movies based on real people that aren't particularly accurate, but just excellent stories with some awesome performances.",movies

"Trivia for any gamers: The owner at the beginning of the movie that refuses to give Pitt's character any more money? The one who is obviously not a professional actor and gives the only dodgy performance in the movie? That is Bobby Kotick the CEO of Activision.

Apparently, it was some kind of trade with the director where Kotick would appear in the movie and the director would work on a project for Activision's Call of Duty Endowment charity.

As to why the director wanted Kotick? No clue. Maybe he thought a real CEO would ad verisimilitude.",I thought he performed fine. He...felt...like a modern baseball team owner. You know: shitty.,movies

- satirizing himself as  a laughably indestructible action hero in the movie within a movie

-  his ""real life""  as  celebrated action star being hounded with offers while playing himself at the movie premier inside of this movie but outside of the movie within the movie (wow, that is meta)

- also some great acting when his character realizes he is fictitious and his life is basically meaningless

Will definitely be adding this to my 4K collection .","It was lost on audiences as they were expecting a Schwarzenegger action film.

She gets to spend the movie making up for her mistake in a world that doesn't trust her.

The film's message about earning trust by giving it becomes a lot stronger if it's Naamari who sets aside her fear and her need to ""do what's right for my people"" and leaves the stone in Raya's hands.",i feel the movie itself would have been much stronger if it focused on sacrifice and redemption from her perspective than raya,movies

I really like this quote from a [Polygon piece](https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2021/3/2/22309833/raya-and-the-last-dragon-dragon-design-disney):

> “The difference between an Eastern or Chinese dragon versus the Nāga is that a Chinese dragon is based on luck and power,” explains screenwriter Qui Nguyen. “And the Nāga, because it’s water, it’s life and hope. It’s just that slight little difference. We didn’t want a dragon that came in to empower [human protagonist] Raya to hit people more; we wanted one that would inspire her to open up and trust.”

and also

> With Raya, the cast and crew approached cultural specificity by integrating a plethora of understated details, small elements that weave together to the fabric of the world.

The world felt so alive, all the details were just so authentic and realistic. I really hope we get to see more of Kumandra in the future.",">understated details

"The visuals looks pretty good, the scenery, the dragons, and the characters designs all are work for me, especially the scenery, this movies took us to the places with varieties, from dessert, floating market, tundra, and Fang's canal, all of them looks visually colorful and stunning.

I think the fighting scene is one of the best fighting scenes in animated movies, it was looks so fluid and dynamic, especially fighting scenes with Namaari in tundra and Fang Castle.

I like that this movie is about Trust and in the final scene Raya beliieve Naamari to trust the magic, and finally she learnt her lesson to trust someone in critical moment, I think complete the arc about her to trust someone again.

I agree with the people that the supporting cast from Tong, Boun, and baby Noi could be annoying but somehow their dynamics worked.","I fucking loved the clear callouts to Muay Thai, JiuJitsu, Filipino Martial Arts, and all four main Chinese weapons at various times.

"Wish the story was as interesting as the animation.

Pretty typical fetch quest plot and I struggle with ""can't we all just get along?"" stories in media now considering that reality has proven time and time again that, no, we can't sadly.

"I'm not sure how to articulate this, but there are some plots I come across that set off my ""dungeons and dragons"" alarm. This movie definitely triggered that. 

It's one of those plots that feels like someone created a homebrew world, a custom character with a tragic backstory, and then set her off on a quest with a rag tag group of heroes to save the world.

I understand that's just like, what we call ""writing"", but this feels a lot like a big budget movie version of someone's homebrewed dnd campaign.

All that said, I really don't mean this as a negative. Just pointing out this feeling I have with stories like this.

"While I did like the visuals, music, and characters I feel the story itself is flawed. There’s absolutely no reason to trust Fang. We see time and time again that they’re selfish and betray others for their own gain. Yet the movie paints them as misunderstood and expects us to just blindly agree. Like, why on earth should Raya get the blame for killing Sisu when Naamari was pulling the trigger on her crossbow? There’s a difference between expecting the worst of people, and having multiple instances proving that a person WILL betray you. The message almost turns toxic, insinuating that you should accept people who keep hurting you. 

If they portrayed Fang as the most untrusting then it would give their nation more depth. Ie. “Heart must be selfishly hoarding food for themselves,” “Raya must be collecting the Dragon Gem pieces to keep for herself,” “Raya must be coming for revenge for her father so we need to stop her,” “Raya and Sisu might attack me so I should bring a weapon to defend myself,” etc.

Also, the Fang general mentioned that they need to expand. Why?? Fang is open-concept central! There’s so much open space! Is it because they need room for crops? herd animals for their cats? Too many people? It feels like a weird, unsupported thing they threw out there.

Finally, I found a lot of the “modern talk” a bit annoying. Especially after Sisu was awoken. I’m particularly not a fan of these kinds of jokes in fantasy movies since it’s just immersion breaking. Towards the end they simmered down and the movie was better for it","While I agree there with the view that there is not a lot of reason to trust Fang, the real moral of the story that I got is that ""distrust"" is a never-ending cycle, and it takes a lot of courage to be the one to be trusting and end that cycle. Yes, Naamari is not trustful, but I think the real point is that it took a lot of strength and humility for Raya to break the cycle of distrust. Like you said, there is absolutely no reason to trust Fang, but the only hope for saving the world was TO trust Fang.

To expand a little bit, I think many are trying to simplify the story by making Fang the ""villain"" (i.e. trying to depict them as the ""Fire Nation"" of the movie). At the very beginning, it was said that the nations splitting was a direct result of these different regions distrust each other. No nation was really the ""villain,"" but each was guilty of their own assumptions, streotyping the other nations, and complete distrust of each nation. The movie starts by showing how suspicious and distrusting each nation was of each other (a simple dinner invite was received with high tension, every nation thinking he other was sus). We are shown the beginning only from Heart's point of view, but I would think if we were shown the point of view from any of the other nations, Heart would probably look just as ""suspicious"" as the others.

In my opinion, the whole final conflict is that it's not about Raya getting the blame or being manipulated into feeling guilty, it's about Raya ACTUALLY being the better person (i.e. the hero of the story) by breaking the cycle of distrust that has plagued this world for hundreds of years (as Sisu has continued to say). Arguably, the flaw of the movie could be we didn't spend enough time with each nation, as it looks like many did not take away this message (which I believe was also the production team's intent).",movies
"I almost feel it would have been better as a 7-10 episode mega-series.  This may be Disney's largest story yet and 2 hours just felt like they couldn't explore their world that much.

Just felt like I wanted more of the world at the end and more time to develop the nations and side characters.  Mostly because Captain Boun is a legend.","I really feel like a series could work, but I dread the feeling of them adding a bunch of useless side plots that add to nothing to story. If they ever make a series of it, it would be cool for it to have a stabilished beginning and end",movies
"While I enjoyed the movie and loved the score, I can’t help but wonder if it would’ve been better as a musical. That might’ve provided the opportunity to flesh out the side characters and smooth out the pacing as Team Raya traveled to each land.

"Could have been fooled this was directed by Tarantino given how many feet shots are in.

Joke aside, this is a good movie, maybe the studio's most action packed to date. The landscapes are gorgeous and the water animation is definetely the quality that was teased with that broken damn in Frozen 2. Some shots are breathtaking and i genuinely forgot i watched animation at some point.


Of course due to the runtime we don't get much time with some side characters, so don't expect big character development from them.
Even so, I enjoyed the humour and mostly well timed, as for the story beats, the climax while predictable and maybe a bit fast, is nice enough.",Side note: Taranto directing and animated movie would be... Interesting.,movies
So did no one catch when they went back to Heart and she said she didn’t realize the dragon statues were there? They were literally behind some vines???,"I mean her dad didnt exactly let her into the temple to hang out. After she finally passed her test and got access, they had the nation gathering.",movies
"There's a lot of pretty good stuff here, especially the relationship between Raya and Namaari. Of course the visuals are phenomenal, and the score is outstanding.

Unfortunately, there's also a lot that really drags it down. The whole conflict is very ""just don't think about it"" and it falls apart the moment you question the characters' actions. There's a lot of rather repetitive fluff, attempting to build up on a theme that ends up being kind of half-hearted.

I appreciate the attempt to show many different and distinct locations, but the worldbuilding ends up being pretty flat for a film that really wants you to appreciate the world and culture in display. I really, really wish the sidequests could have been straight up removed so the plot could focus on what really matters, the arc with the protagonist and the antagonist. The final confrontation between Raya and Namaari is really good, but I struggled to really care after a lot of meandering and a very, very predictable resolution.

At least Awkwafina didn't ruin the movie like I feared she would.",It sounds like this movie would have worked better as an actual TV show,movies
"Eh idk. It was gorgeously animated but overall it felt kinda hollow. It reminded me a lot of Avatar: The Last Airbender (like a lot a lot, make human Sisu the protagonist and it’s the same goddamn thing lol), except the characters weren’t as fleshed out. I definitely preferred Moana, which is another movie that it shares similarities with.","Those are the two comparisons I kept making. I was worried the Druun were going to be the dragons or something a little too close to te ka. Now I'm wondering if that would've been better. Sisu's explanation satisfies why trust was the magic that works against them, but feels a little...underdeveloped in terms of why there are giant purple people eaters.",movies
Why did the Talon Chief sound like Betty White?,I thought the same at first! Lucille Soong voices her. She's in lots of different movies and shows but I know her mainly as the grandma in Fresh Off the Boat.,movies
"I'm not gonna touch on the story/world having the depth of a puddle or the paper-thin characters. But what even was the point of finding Sisu? She didn't do anything, just tagged along with Raya. She got new powers with each gem piece....and then she died and never used them to fight the monsters. Everything is solved by the humans putting the gem back together themselves. 

You can literally remove Sisu from the story and it doesn't change. Call it ""Raya's Journey"" or whatever. Raya travelling alone to collect the gem pieces. I mean she already knew where they were, she didn't even need Sisu to help her locate them.

Also I couldn't understand a single thing the big lunky dude was saying he was so mumbly and growly.","I mostly agree. The only argument I could make is that without Sisu they wouldn’t have trusted each other. But yeah, the writing was bad.",movies
"I thought it was pretty messy. The film had directors and lead actor change late in the production, and if you've seen the making of Frozen 2 doco on Disney Plus you get a sense of what probably went down here.

"Overall I enjoyed the movie and there's no denying the animation was great but I'm a little disappointed in what I feel the story could've been, at least if it wasn't catered towards 6 year olds.

* Namaari = Zuko, both pressured to do the wrong thing by their evil parent who rules their nation.
* Sisu believes in trust, which almost gets her killed by Namaari = Aang believes in pacifism which almost gets him killed by Fire Lord Ozai.
* Raya trusts Namaari ending in Sisu being shot dead = Katara trusts Zuko in Ba Sing Se and he stabs her in the back with Aang being shot dead.

"I feel like everyone talking about the SFX in this movie might be because we're all avoiding the elephant in the room here.... the writing. This movie had its moments, but MAN you could tell this was not a Pixar movie. So much cringe writing, I chuckled a few times, but within 5 minutes of meeting Sisu, I was really tired of that character. She got less grating eventually but would still have really annoying moments. I usually like Awkwafina but this was like Awkwafina concentrate.   


It was also just incredibly predictable, and I usually don't \*really\* have a problem with that and I don't usually try to predict where movies will go, but this was just so predictable it stood out for me.   


The use of tons of modern slang felt really awkward too. It'll date this movie unlike maybe any animated Disney movie I've seen before. I can't think of any examples at the moment, but it just had lingo in there that, 20 years from now, will stick out like a sore thumb. Nobody watching Toy Story is thinking ""oh God I remember when we used to say that"". Maybe a nitpick, but that's the type of shit you usually see in other animated movies that use top 10 radio songs as their soundtrack.   


Overall I enjoyed it, but definitely not a new classic for me. It had that potential, with the ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" kind of story of uniting the tribes, but it didn't nail it. Like another commenter said, this might have been better served as a series where we didn't spend literally 5 minutes tops in any given tribe locale.","Hard agree. Good visual, poor writing",movies

"Just finished watching. I gave it a 7/10 because I enjoyed the scenery a lot and animation was beautiful. Story wasn't too exciting and pretty predictable and sadly, not that unique. As for the many Avatar: The Last Airbender connections people made from watching the trailer, I gotta say the movie didn't make me thing of it at all, which went against my prediction.

Nevertheless, better than expected and probably will watch it again in theatre.",The shape of her face is quite close to our Indonesian [naga](https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2017/2/24/a/e/1/ae182246-fab1-11e6-840b-a1c83e23836e.jpg).,movies
"I enjoyed it for the amazing visuals, fun characters (the puppy line for example), and cool action choreography, but the story was all style over substance.

Like...they have a top secret vault without a *ceiling in it*? Really? And they only have two security guardians--one of whom is what, only twelve or thirteen before the time-skip?--for the most valuable artifact in the whole world that armies are willing to mobilize for? Again...*really*?

And the whole movie was filled with stuff like this. Sisu can be revived just cause. They can put together the broken gem without Sisu just 'cause of the power of friendship and trust--never mind that Raya was right and that trusting people would have got them killed multiple times. The Druun are repelled by water and the freaking dragon with the ability to make it rain can't drive them back just 'cause.  The dragons had been supposedly fighting these guys to the bitter end, then the last five of them combine their powers to banish them...they really couldn't have done that sooner?

I'm not normally one to try to intentionally poke holes in stuff, but these were extremely obvious things.

Wait a few months so you don't have to pay $30, then watch it for the cool visuals IMO.","> they have a top secret vault without a ceiling in it? Really?

"It was okay. The movie looked absolutely breathtaking, the music was excellent and the action great, but the story felt too formulated for me. It doesn't give us time to get attached to the myriad of characters they introduce, and we only jump places to places without feeling the urgence of the situation. OK, the purple-thing is terrible and means end of the world, but we only see it twice in the movie? Its threat is mostly explained then shown. There's a lot of exposition throughout the movie that was unnecessary.

Also, there's a lot of unanswered question. Why are the statues positioned like that? Why some statues are not? Why does Sisu is revived when the dragons come back? Also, the main message of ''we have to trust each other'' is pretty much undermined by the multiple occasions where it's proven that WE SHOULDN'T.

Also, I can't get over the dragons design. It's My Little Pony all over again, but uglier.

Overall I DID enjoy it, it's a fun movie, but it's definitely not on par with some of the best Disneys.",Idk why they weren’t in the poses at the end but the rest of the stone people were in an offering pose which goes along with sisus gift giving to illicit trust motif,movies
"I personally found it to be meh. The story pacing felt off and a lot of the conflict is exaggerated, stretched out, and unbelievable. Character development was bad. I understand it's a fantasy movie, but there needs to be inner logic and this movie lacked it. Animation felt off too at times, but the soundtrack was good.","Agreed. It felt overanimated at times. Too much emotion, reminding me a little of the Panasonic Zelda games. This smells like a b-team animation direction team.
All the tech would have been centralised and they’re not doing much new. Hair is done, snow is done, water, fabric, smoke, all done.

The story was pretty straightforward in this, find the magic mcguffin and use it to save the world all the while meeting new friends and learning a valuable lesson along the way.  For me one of the major drawbacks of the film were the side characters.  I didn't find them endearing and barely tolerated their presence throughout the film.  Sisu was annoying at times and the villain left much to be desired.   The animation and score were beautiful though and I did enjoy the action sequences.  Overall I'd give it a 7/10",[deleted],movies

"I enjoyed it a lot even if I felt the pacing and some of the writing felt off. It's also a really beautiful looking movie, despite having some scenes that looked like the environment felt too small.

And I think all the characters are good but would have benefitted from more development which is definitely an easier said than done type of thing. But when they're on the boat thinking about the people they've lost and got turned to stone, it's a quiet moment that I think worked well. It really speeds through to get there but that little pause is nice. And I thought the ending was well done with Raya turning to stone first. For me personally it didn't feel like a deus ex machina but a very human moment of having to trust each other. Which is a very Disney lesson but that scene worked for me. It's kind of surprising how much I liked the whole third act. Usually that's were animated movies kind of drag for me.

And it's really silly but I really liked seeing what Vietnamese things that brought to the story. Simple things like Raya calling her dad ""ba"" and Raya saying Namaari is ""dep la."" I get excited for that stuff! And hopefully other South East Asian countries got some of that too. If anything I wish there was more of that.","Filipinos got the Bagoong + unripe mangoes shot in the end credits (where Namari and Raya are eating it together) and some of the fighting style + Escrima sticks!

It has a good message but poor execution. The characters are forgettable  with little personality, especially Raya who lacked charisma.

It’s very possible the production of this film suffered due to the pandemic, with different teams working on it remotely. Late changes in directors and multiple writers lead me to believe that was the case. While not a lost cause, the movie is forgettable and one of Disney’s weakest animated efforts in the last several years.","Totally agree on the animation quality.

"This will probably get downvoted to hell, but I feel like some people here are misreading the ‘trust’ theme a bit.

Yes, there was no reason to trust Fang at all. When Raya decides to ‘take the first step’ at the end, she knows Fang are a bunch of bastards and Namaari will still likely screw her over anyway, but she does it anyway. Not because she’s suddenly drunk on the ‘trust everyone’ kool-aid, but because she’s learned that the only way to salvage an important relationship that’s been broken is for *someone* to be a goddamn selfless hero about it and trust the other side again first, despite knowing full well they might get boned by the other party for taking the risk.

It wasn’t fair to Raya that she had to trust that shithead Namaari to save the world. That’s what made Raya’s decision courageous.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk


Edit: Also, the supposedly ‘evil’ queen of Fang you all keep saying should be lynched only wanted to steal the gems and dragon so that Fang could save everyone turned to stone themselves and therefore avoid being punished for their earlier mistake. Not exactly an evil motive, just misguided","While I get what you mean, Namaari and Raya's relationship solely consists of ""Raya trusts Namaari, Namaari betrays Raya for selfish reasons."" In order for a message like this to work the story needs to spend more time with Fang to really show us their point of view. We get hints that Fang is a broken country but are never really shown their plights or why they'd want to stop Raya. I think we were supposed to get the impression that Fang's becoming crowded and is running out of land for food, but in the brief instances where we see Fang everyone seems fine and happy. So their attempts to stop Raya just comes across as them being power-hungry. There's no real distrust from Fang's perspective, so Raya being brave and taking the first step doesn't come across that way. It comes across as just allowing someone to hurt you again, and again, and again.

This would've been solved if they turned this movie into a mini-series instead and let us properly see the characters and world, imo. There's not a lot of time allotted for proper character and world expansion in a movie.",movies

"My opinion of this is that the movie was kinda eh. Visually, I think it looks fantastic. The environments, clothing, and other visual details all look beautiful. Storywise, I found the movie rather shallow. There's a lot that happens in a relatively short runtime, and there's not a lot time to get to know the characters all that well as a result. The movie basically feels like a ""Go here and get the thing"" fetch quest, with none of the lands of this world really being particularly fleshed out or made interesting. This is also kind of a personal thing, but I really didn't find this movie funny. Disney's not been a stranger to this kind of humor in the past, but I feel other movies have done it better or at least minimized it to a level I don't find as offensive. This movie is just full of really juvenile humor, and I don't think I really laughed at a single joke. I think what killed it for me was the baby. I get it's a kids' movie, but I really feel it pushed my own personal limits for this kind of juvenile humor. I also was not a fan of Sisu or the role she plays in the movie's lesson about trust. I hate her design, for one. Everyone and their mother has said that she looks like dragon Elsa at this point, and it's very true. Could they not have picked a better design for her? Asian dragons can look pretty interesting and badass. Why was this frankly kind of ugly design the one they went with? There was also something about Awkwafina's performance I didn't dig. I suppose she did a decent job, but she's arguably my least favorite performance in the movie. My biggest issue with the movie is really the trust message, however. I don't dislike the movie's message on principle. But the movie basically just tells you that blind trust is a great idea. Raya has every reason not to trust Namaari after she betrayed it prior and basically destroyed Raya's entire people in the process. And Namaari has never done anything to prove that she's worthy of Raya's trust or forgiveness since. Sisu's blind trust in people is also consistently met with failure. And yet it's Raya who is consistently shamed for not being willing to trust Namaari or being suspicious of people in general. And at the climax of the movie, for some reason Raya opts to trust the person who has already betrayed her twice. Now, I'm not saying you should never trust anyone ever. But blind trust is unbelievably naive, and it really bugs me that this is the broken sort of message the movie is advocating for. Overall, I think this movie is a 6/10. Pretty animation, decent performances, pretty weak story.",">There was also something about Awkwafina's performance I didn't dig.

"What's up with Disney being so focused on visuals that the writing has gone to crap. I might be in the minority here but Raya was a terrible movie.

The Druun being nothing more than smoke that turn people to stone is so weak. What were they? What was their goal. Where did they come from. The Druun are so  boring and only there as a plot device without any real depth.

The whole plot of 4 McGuffins is also really boring. Go here take crystal. Go here take crystal. It's so basic, and so easy. Running around the map and getting the crystals and it wasn't even that difficult to get them. 

And that ending. Just throw in that last minute power of friendship nonsense and suddenly the magic works. Really? Really???

"Honestly the movie felt like if they crammed 4 seasons of avatar the last air bender into one movie and it worked... at least in trying to create a concrete story that can be told in 2 hours.

I mean in that the story work as a movie but it could have worked a lot better with proper developments of each region and also development of each of the many side characters. Instead, its more of a dash to the finish and the character growth of namaari or HER MOM seems too sudden or illogical in the grand scheme of things.

Beautiful visuals like really amazing worlds and the water looks gorgeous. Also, the different regions seem super small in comparison to like the different nations in avatar, like just 5 different villages? And why are all plague like creatures always depicted as mist or clouds, kinda want it to be some actual mystical creatures or something but I digress.

I enjoyed the film overall but a series would have probably been the better choice for a journey across different cities and developing the villains and people more. Then again, it might become too similar to atla lol. 

Enjoyable movie with breathtaking visuals but a rather simple story.

"For all the things I loved about this movie, the one glaring problem I have with it, that ate at me throughout the entire runtime, was the moral. It was honestly awful.

Most morals in this type of media are meant to be and able to be applied to a real life situation. Lion King? Embrace your truth. Ratatouille? You can do whatever you put your mind to. Mulan? Everyone has the power to be a hero.

Raya? Trust people...

That's the gist of it. Despite your inhibitions, your history, your fears, no matter how warranted they are, just trust people.

That's no lesson anyone living on this planet should be taught, lol. What's a more valuable, and true moral theme is that, not everyone is worthy of your trust. Not everyone is good. 

This theme only really can be applied to an idealized world, because only in an idealized world will a mindset like this yield fruit.

What's bizarre is, before it finally pays off in the end, the film proves several times that blind trust is *not* a safe way to live. Its proven by the dragons when they sacrifice themselves, then by Raya when she trusts the little girl from Fang Clan, then by Raya again, when she trusts the infant, by Sisu when she trusts the clan chief.

And when Raya makes the leap, to trust her enemy, and is presented with a crossbow to the face, we're supposed to see her as wrong when she responds negatively to that? ""I wasn't going to shoot you, you're also at fault for what happened to Sisu!""

What? *What?*

This, coming from the woman who's been hunting you, and is responsible for the greatest betrayal of your life, which resulted in the apocalypse? Right, lol.","""Hey little girl, do you want to see a puppy?""

It seemed like Disney kind of set their bar for the next age of movies with Moana. Compared to Moana, this film was a disorganized jumble of loose ideas. The dialogue of all the side characters was used for incredibly low-effort jokes instead of any development. Whenever they wanted you to connect with one of the side characters they turned on the sad music and had them talk about losing their family. Otherwise, they really had no development throughout the movie. In Moana, we got Maoi. Maoi was a flawed character, he went through an arc, and by the end his story was memorable and it felt like it beautifully tied into the message of the movie and Moana's own journey. In this movie, the story just ended with three gimmicks: kid with high self-esteem, stealing baby, and tough softie. A closer example of character development done right is Mulan. Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po are characters that go through an arc, and the viewer bonds with them through the course of the film even though at the start they seemed like three total loonies. The difference is that every scene in Mulan, every shot, serves a purpose to drive the characters and the story forward.

The amount of unrelated or extraneous information in Raya that doesn't develop the characters or the story is unusually high for Disney and it makes for a less enjoyable movie than it could have been. The scene where she returns the amulet, the scene where Fang is explaining their space problems, the scenes of each of them going through their plans to return the amulet, etc. This time where they could just show Bangs Girl in her room feeling conflicted and then the amulet appears on the window sill or taking out a good twenty minutes of banter would have saved a ton of time for the real messages of the movie.

Don't keep writing lines for Raya that say ""I have trust issues"" SHOW US THAT RAYA HAS TRUST ISSUES!!! You have the best 3D animators in the world working for you, use them!! We go straight from dialogue about how she hates the people in the water town to her hiring the baby that just stole from her to get one of the gem pieces that she is staking her father's life on. It totally removes Raya's personality and issues from the story and makes it more predictable.

There is way too much of the characters talking about the themes of the story in this film. You don't need Maoi or Moana telling you their issues, because that's not all that they are. They're characters who come to life on the screen and behave like real human beings. Their issues are deep and they're just doing their best to work through them. If someone walked around saying they had trust issues they probably wouldn't have trust issues. They would just try harder to trust people. I would expect Raya to only rely on other characters only when she has no other choice, to not trust others where some people may fall for empathy, and to try to keep everyone at a distance so she's not at risk of being hurt again. Instead, Raya immediately connects with anyone who shows some sign that they've experienced what she has and trusts them with things that are super important to her.

It's not like she's consistently punished or rewarded for placing trust though, sometimes it's shown as a really good thing, and then in the next scene, it does her in. It would have been nice to see her consistently not trusting others no matter what they've been through, but through conflict being forced to expand her circle and boundaries bit by bit until she reaches the final person that there's no way she could ever forgive and giving that trust leads to the world being saved and Raya overcoming the scars of her past. Someone else made the point that she just keeps putting trust in people who hurt her and it's almost a negative message that you should keep harmful people in your life just because it's the ""right thing to do"".

These are just my thoughts but it's really just me venting about what the movie could have been. For people who write stories, Disney has always been an inspiration with each story they tell. To see one that feels so far from their best is discouraging. Is this what qualifies for a success in the market today?  


TLDR: The movie was amazing in every aspect but the writing. The characters weren't as strong as they should have been and the plot was disjointed but it was still a fun watch.","I felt the humor bogged it down too. I don’t mind constant humor that relates to the story, for instance—the body swap in SOUL brought jokes that related to the situation at hand. Those were mostly funny. RAYA attempted to bring in “relatable” humor from *our* world into a fantastical setting like the one this film set up, and it ended up taking away from how immersed I could’ve been in the story.

Examples: group project joke, credit-card joke",movies
im still watching it but i think the music doesn't really fit the movie and the story is predictable af.,"I mean

It’s a disney movie for kids

Does the villain ever win?  

Does the main lead ever fail her quest?",movies
The world building just felt so good in this movie and the pacing was excellent,"The world-building only came in the form of *literal* exposition. They never travelled from one place to the next except through scene-cuts teleporting them to their destination. We know absolutely nothing about the tribes except what was told in the beginning. Axe-warriors, thieves and merchants, etc. We know nothing about the Druun. 

There was almost no actual world building in this movie. Maybe what you meant is that you think things looked pretty.",movies
I loved the movie a lot and the visuals but I was a bit confused about how Sisu came back to life ? Can anyone explain? Also I wanted to choke Namaari for telling Raya she was equally at fault for everything since “she didn’t trust her”.... like no duh she didn’t trust you!  You literally ended the world... practically twice !!!!!,Sisu came back to life because the dragons came back to life and used Magical Dragon Powers to spin around in a helix and resurrect her.,movies
Awkwafina ruined this movie for me.,Her raspy voice actually worked as a dragon for me...,movies

Does anyone else think that the design of of Namaari look just like that girl from Incredibles 2? And not just the hair, but also her facial expressions, her movements etc.

"It was decent overall and I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would.

I can’t help but feel like it could have used more depth to up the risk bar and make the win feel bigger. Everything seemed a bit too easy.

I also just wish the dragon didn’t talk.  It was unnecessary and the movie would have worked just fine without that.  The dragon could have communicated the same points other ways.  That said, it wasn’t as annoying as I thought it would be. But it did take me out of it.  Especially, talking about night lights and group projects in school, and making cheesy jokes.

It also just really seems like the dragon could have just walked up to each of these places, wowed everyone and they would have been super happy to get their family and friends back and would have just given it the stone.  I feel like raya didn’t even need to be involved.  “Oh shit, that super awesome dragon we thought was dead is alive again and wants this stone back to fix the world and bring our love ones back!  Yep, here you go!”

Anyway, enjoyed it with the family and it looked amazing.  Probably only a one time watch for me, but zero regrets.",">It also just really seems like the dragon could have just walked up to each of these places, wowed everyone and they would have been super happy to get their family and friends back and would have just given it the stone.

I mean, this is basically the point Sisu is making the whole time.  EVERYBODY but the Fang leader gets one look at Sisu and is immediately like, Okay how do we help.

Raya's lack of ability to trust constantly makes things harder.",movies
"I feel like the people asking for the Fang to be punished either missed the point of the movie, are too cynical, or both.

"It was good but definitely nowhere near the same level as Frozen or Moana. The lack of songs and the awful development of the antagonists really hurt it IMO.

Awkwafina is definitely the GOAT tho, she steals every single scene.","Felt the opposite. Didn't care for songs, thought Awkwafina was annoying. Sisu was basically just Awkwafina in everything she's in. But I do agree that there was lack of development (all over the place).",movies

"Raya and the Last Dragon was very underwhelming to what Disney is when it's at top form. There's nothing really outright bad about it per se, but it plays the standard Disney formula safe and ultimately is just an Animated Movie you'll barely remember outside of a couple of scenes. It simply doesn't have that Disney magic the classics had and you wish it aimed for higher levels. A Paint-by-numbers Dragon Chick Flick.

Most of the characters aside from Raya and Sisu are so bland that I can't remember their names and don't really get any character development. They're there just as comic relief and backup support. You won't remember the villain or the locations all that much either. Sisu the Dragon is alright in small doses as she gets a few okay lines and gags that are standard Disney fare. I didn't find her too annoying surprisingly and her powers give her some good scenes here and there when given the chance.

Raya gets a prologue that sets up her character and the main story of the film. Considering all the scenes and characters it uses, it doesn't really pay off all that well. The antagonists are so painfully obvious that I was kind of hoping something else would happen, but alas some dumb and contrived things happen to make the actual story begin. It becomes very predictable and kind of lazy for a big chunk of the film. To give the writers some credit though near the end it gets a bit better as the themes and emotional moments come together, but for the most part it's just a watchable quest fetch adventure trip.

The Animation is as expected very beautiful and smooth. The fight sequences are nicely done and locations are big and colourful. Voice work is good and the music fits well with the type of film it is. I'm sure it would look and sound great in theatres. The film's pacing is also fast and never feels like it drags, so kids will sit through this without much of a fuss easily.

Overall, Raya and the Last Dragon is just there. It's neither good or bad really, it's borderline mediocre-passable. The jokes are a mixed bag, the story is safe and generic for the most part, and it doesn't leave you with a big impression after seeing it. If I wanted to rewatch a story with a Girl and Dragon in it, I'd watch the original Mulan from Disney. 5.5/10",I agree 100% with your review and I'm someone this movie was marketed to (SEA descent),movies
"It was great.  Classic Disney.  My only real issue is that Raya has no character flaws except, what I believe, is that she doesn't trust people.  Yet, the people that she shouldn't trust are non-trustworthy.  I just felt like Raya is a great character without a real flaw.",Really? She made like 100 mistakes in the movie,movies
"Spoilers!

Ok ok so am I the only one who thought it was ballsy that the disney princess didn’t save the day? An that the Disney princess died? 

And I also though they should have stayed stone so there story of sacrifice could be told.",Yeah I was expecting them to stay stone so it could be full circle like how the dragons sacrificed themselves,movies

How do all the dragons come back at the end? Didnt they do the same thing with the orb at the beginning of the film yet all the dragons stayed dead?,"The humans did it this time so it had more power or something. Don't think too hard about it, movie's rushed.",movies

"As a SEAsian, combining cultures/influences from different Southeast Asian countries made this movie weirdly unrecognizable.

Overall, compared to other Disney animated films, this one is easily the most forgettable- thematically speaking and plot-wise (formulaic & lots of tropes).

The two dimensional side characters and the lack of songs don't help either.

On the other hand, this is dope if you're into visuals.",Its mostly Laos and Cambodia. So for people from that area it was amazing. Cause no one ever gives Laos credit or representation,movies
"I made my [first ever Youtube vid](https://youtu.be/2GpCBm3k83U) cosplaying Raya, and discussing some of the controversies the movie has faced even before its release - I also share my own, and other Southeast Asians' opinions on these issues. 

I hope my video helps educate everyone about the cultural issues surrounding this film! I'd love to hear what everyone thinks as well.","Disney didnt make up its own story, the Dragon Gem legend comes from Laos. Raya is 100% based on Laos (Heart) and Cambodia (Fang), with Vietnam (Spine), Myanmar (Talon) and Thailand (Tail) sprinkled in. I know they like to say the included Indonesia and Philipines etc into it. But its mostly based on those 5 countries and its history with eachother. I mean Laos is even nicknamed ""The HEART of South East Asia""",movies
"Just like in Soul, they chose the ""safe"" ending instead of a darker one. Sisu and the other dragons should've stayed dead/in stone. That was the whole point of her death, to unite people.",I thought that was where they were going. It would have worked if Namaari was a bit less directly responsible for her death.,movies
"Not the biggest fan of the movie because I think it's unrealistic but I understand the message they're getting at

I think it plays into how tense race relations are in today's society and kinda promote the idea of forgiveness despite past struggles. Now I think it's will never work because like Raya, I don't trust people given that people are just inherently greedy/selfish to believe that people are gonna hold hand and sing kubaya. 

Perhaps, it can be realized where where people would set aside their differences and join together. Or perhaps, it's just a fairytale.","The movie never rewards Raya for trust (except at the end, when a Happy Ending was required), and actively punishes Sisu for trust. Raya trusted Namaari as a child and triggered the apocalypse; Raya trust Namaari as an adult snd Namaari shot Sisu in the heart. 

Sisu tries to go shopping on credit and is nearly lynched. She is rescued by local boss lady who attempts to kill her. She also trusted Namaari and is shot in the heart. 

Meanwhile, Raya pays half up front for her boat ride and half when they get there, thus establishing trust. She buys the baby gang’s loyalty with food, thus establishing trust. She is captured by Tang and they join together on mutual objectives to save the world, this establishing trust. Raya is constantly having to save Sisu from blindly trusting. 

There is no reason for Raya to trust Namaari at the end, except that the plot demands it. It would make more sense for Namaari to give Raya her piece and have Raya create the orb.",movies
"Can someone please help explain to me how the dragons magically came back at the end after the sphere was repaired?

Why did the dragons return in the end?

I gave it a 10/10 on IMDb to offset the intentional negative reviews, but it’s more like a 8.5/10 — there’s so much to love, mainly the visuals: holy fuck, so so so good. I kept thinking how many movies would benefit from this kind of treatment, but I believe there’s a lot of heart in this story — with a majority of it focused on trust and finding the good in people. Some of it can come across as forced, but seeing it with my family helped cement how important the exposition was. I wasn’t expecting much from this movie, but it’s a great blend of the animated version of *Mulan* and the joyous adventures from *Indiana Jones*.

No white representation at all, not even a minor character, and let's make the war criminal the most like China's race so we can try to slowly conform the world to the CCP.  Good Job Disney.  The sound, cinematography, the art, effects were amazing though.  Voice actors were great as well.  Also, if they can stand any form of Water, not just moving water then why not make it rain 24/7?  I guess Water represents life/passage of time and the Dune turn things to stone and stop the living thing in time so maybe it needs to be a body of water as rain drops might not constitute time flowing.

The one thing that disappointed me was how “family friendly” they made it. They removed all the F-bombs and completely toned it down. To me, those were the jokes that really made the first movie - like in the first one when Eddie is yelling about the garbage on the street, for example.

It's so bombastic compared to the original and like an hour in feels like no one has any sort of defined character. Why are we sidelining the fuck out of Lisa? Why are we not spending more time with Akeem bonding with his son? Why is Akeem not having a single conversation with his daughters? What we know of him is that he is a pretty caring guy who specifically wants to feel a connection with his loved ones. I wouldn't mind him behaving off if the movie was allowing any of these characters to feel developed outside of him but all the characterization for the oldest daughter has been her looking grumpy in and out of montages. His son is hardly any more developed than that with all we know of him being that he's ambitious maybe? And his love interest is his groomer whose name I think I missed somehow? Maybe it's gonna pick up but this first hour has been a massive disappointment.

"The only thing I'm not feeling so far is that once they get back to Zoomunda,  Eddie and Arsenio really become background characters.   Eddie really isn't a big presence in the movie,  and Arsenio seems almost forgotten, which I understand is a sacrifice to develop the new younger characters, but it gives the movie a uniquely different feel and I'm not sure better so far.  I haven't gotten to the end yet though so may revise but the middle of the movie feels like a different movie altogether.

Edit:  Overall,  I thought it was entertaining, but the middle of the movie is a bit of a drag.  Eddie and Arsenio really aren't that featured, and there is an awkwardly forced arc for Eddie at the end about him swaying from progressive to tradionalist.   What works for the movie is pure nostaligia and it feels like getting a visit from old friends.  But there too many new characters and too many subplots that move even Eddie to the background and that brings it down a notch.  Still worth a watch.

"I wanted to love this.  And I enjoy it.  I’d give it like a 3/5, with a solid acknowledgment that a good part of that score is rooted in nostalgia and affection for the first movie.  

But what happened here?

This movie didn’t look like it was ever meant to go to theaters.  The sets looked grand (stylistically) but small.  How many horizontal shots across the width of a (implied) grand room do you need before you notice the lack of scale?  How many times do you need to see scenes obfuscated by objects in the foreground, before it seems apparent that it was an attempt to hide how small the space is?  Or how the movie was strangely lit in a way, very common these days, that makes everything colorful but flat?  And the opportunities afforded by green screens don’t surpass or even equal how impressive it would be to show those things/buildings/scenery/animals practically. 

This movie was all about the cast.  I would literally watch Eddie Murphy read a phone book if he got to give it his early-career, R rated spin.  Arsenio, Shari Headley, John Amos, Paul Bates; all of them, they were bright spots in the movie.  The new additions were fine or great.  Wesley Snipes keeps showing why he has a career to resurrect (he can deliver when he wants to).  Tracy Morgan, Leslie Jones, great.  I wasn’t as interested in the new characters at first, but at least the old ones weren’t entirely shunted off to the side here.  

But this movie needed a bigger budget.  Bigger spaces- the royal ballroom should be twice as deep!  More extras- fill a grand space, don’t just fill a mid-sized room!  This is the Royal Palace of Zamunda, not a damn overflow ballroom at the Hyatt Regency in Paramus.   The architectural flourishes were nice, but every room should be far bigger.  They were in the original.  The scale of those rooms and the crowd scenes made it seem like Zamunda was a kingdom of about 50 people, total.  

I’ll give them this: they gave us something new.  This isn’t a Star Wars ANH/TFA sequel.  This isn’t a, “if you love the plot of the first one, then get ready to enjoy it as we redo all those scenes you love again” sequel.  They barely “came to America” this time.  This movie was all about Zamunda.  I just wish they’d had more money to do it with.  And that the cinematography looked like a movie, and not just a TV show.  And I miss the F bombs.  Maybe not from King Akeem, but those guys in the barber shop should have been able to cut loose again.  

I’m glad they made it.  I watched it, I enjoyed it.  It could have been more.","The original movie looked more believable than this one.

Great comedy. I loved the cast most of all. It was like coming home and seeing old friends.

Enjoyed every minute of it. I was very worried, but it worked. Its a great tribute to the original and I'm glad it was made.

The call backs to the original film were well done. The updates for the modern audience worked (but what do I know.) The wink and nod of *Nextdoria* and Wesley Snipes role and that family has me laughing still. The blatant insertion of icons from Gladys Knight to Salt & Pepa, and En Vogue. And the commitment to keeping Eddie as the wide-eyed Akeem and Arsenio as the sneaky Semmi was so great.

Shari Headly and Leslie Jones going from ""Why are these mashed potatoes black"" to getting wasted and singing humpty. John Amos being John Amos. James Earl Jones being James Earl Jones. And Oha being Oha. It was good seeing Louis Anderson in a McDowell's in the middle of Zamunda too.

(edit : I forgot *Paul Schrader*, *Terrence Malick*, I insist on USA since you may be more familiar with American cinema and see lots of faced movies from there, but there are movies which will please you from every country, from every period)

I found the story to be engaging enough but the comedy was strangely woke but also outdated and out of place at the same time.,That's a prime description of Gen X comedy writers.,movies
"It didn’t work for me. It had a few funny moments, but overall it didn’t live up to the first one. I thought they dropped the ball on basically every aspect. Eddie Murphy is kinda playing the straight man, so the movie relies on everyone else to be funny, but no one really is. Arsenio Hall isn’t in it much, neither is Tracey Morgan. Lisa from the first movie was pretty funny, and Wesley Snipes is great. There was this woman power thing with his daughter wanting to be the queen, but she’s just there and I didn’t care. Last is the romance between his son and the royal barber. They weren’t bad actors or anything, but had zero chemistry with each other. 

So yeah, disappointed by it. Wish it was rated R. I don’t think that would’ve saved it or anything but maybe the jokes would have been funnier. Yes I laugh at swear words. Talented cast, no sparks from the love story, wish it were funnier. 4/10","A lot of what drove the first movie (I watched it again a few weeks back) was how quickly the movie got us on Akeem's side.

A lesser actor and/or a weaker script would have probably left audiences wondering why  we care about this rich and out-of-touch douchebag.  It even allows us to forgive the dumber moments (a well-read and educated prince who's read Nietzsche doesn't know you don't stop someone in a car by standing in front of it, and can't come up with a better cover story than being a student at a made up college?).

Take away that sense of ""Akeem, a wise and thinking prince, bucking tradition because it's something we can all get behind"" and the movie gets itself lost almost immediately:

Why doesn't Akeem get a paternity test?

Why can't he just make Meeka the heir, especially considering he married a self-sufficient independent woman?

If his kingdom is so important, why would anyone around him not tell him (Semmi especially) that anyone who wasn't raised to be a king probably wouldn't be a good one?

Why doesn't he has a figure in his life that's presented as wise and unflappable at the outset (like Queen Aeoleon; the original movie was clever enough to set up that she's the reason why he fell for Lisa - a dynamic that was completely ignored by this movie)?

Why is the movie not mostly set in America?

All in all, this is a movie that is a product of present-day Hollywood: wants the perks of the brand without even making an attempt to understand why the brand has the pedigree it has in the first place.",movies

I wanted to like it but I found it very mediocre.,"i FOUND IT A CHORE TO GET THROUGH, sorry caps.
I am amazed someone as funny as Eddie and Arsenio couldnt even improv some comedy for this, the script is atrocious.  Felt like  a tv  pilot rehashing plot from the original for a reboot.  Its like Wow Black Panther just made 2 bilion dollars at the Box Office, lets cobble up something together and make it family friendly get some of that sweet home streaming  money.  But Amazon went , well here's 40 million dollars, dont spend it all in one day.",movies
"I was disappointed by this movie. Here are two glaring issues:

1. The original took itself seriously. The sequel does not. In the original, Akeem really does want to find a bride and fall in love. The stakes are high- if he doesn't find his true love in America he has to marry the obedient, barking girl. He wants a partner- to be challenged. And the movie takes that goal very seriously. The character of Akeem, and many others, take themselves very seriously. Sure, there are tons of great crazy characters and laughs at every turn, but it's grounded in a love story that feels genuine. The characters feel dynamic too- Even Daryl (the original's villain) isn't some one-dimensional character. He feels real! Lisa's sister is cooky and crazy, but not so over the top she feels like a caricature....Compare that to the sequel: The sequel isn't grounded in anything. Not in goals, relationships, or the individual characters themselves. Every character is ridiculous and over the top- even Akeem.  The only character that somewhat felt like the vibe of the first movie was the eldest daughter- who had almost nothing to do with the plot at all. Besides her, no one in this movie takes themself seriously. And if they do take themselves seriously it isn't consistent. The few times they do attempt to ground the movie through its character and the relationships/struggles, it clashes with the previous goof-ball tone and antics and just comes off as insincere....A lion lifts its leg and farts at one point. One minute later is when Akeem's son is supposedly doing something super dangerous. If you really want to analyze the difference in tone compare these two scenes: Original - Akeem beats up the robber in Macdowells versus Sequel- Akeem's son outsmarting the lion to pass the princely trials. It's night and day. 
2. Akeems' son's story arch was all over the place. So much so, that I imagine someone took the original screenplay and rewrote it to the point where they lost sight of basic screenwriting 101 methods.  The movie starts with Akeem's son wanting to prove himself by getting a good job. He wants a career. He goes into a job interview and takes it very seriously...that doesn't last very long as the interviewer is some caricature of a privileged white boss and the interview spirals into ridiculousness (See point 1 above about how nothing takes itself seriously in this movie and most of the characters aren't dynamic). Then Akeem's son goes to Africa to become the crown prince. Then- out of nowhere- he falls in love with the girl cutting his hair who he spoke to twice. Who is she? I have no clue. It's not like the Lisa/Akeem love story. This is a D sub-plot jammed into the movie around the midpoint that somehow ends up taking over the final act...I'm thoroughly confused. He runs away and marries her...when did he even want to get married? If they wanted to do a romance arc for Akeem's son, then commit to that! Why introduce him by wanting to have a career and scalping tickets for money? Instead, start it with him on blind dates and vocalizing he wants to find a woman and settle down. Make that his goal. Make that his arc. OR scrap the love story altogether and come up with something better. 

Other thoughts:

The whole thing felt sloppy. The movie had NO stakes at all. None. I didn't care if Akeem's son didn't marry the hair girl because they didn't genuinely develop that relationship in any significant way. I wasn't even concerned about Akeem's problem about not having a male heir, because it wasn't pressing; Akeem was the king, so the crown prince wouldn't rule Zamunda until he died.",Good points all around.,movies
Wow Eddie Murphy turned down Ryan Coogler's idea to make this? Such garbage.,"I'm not sure why this was even a Coming To America sequel.

Any of the characters from the original could have easily been replaced by oc's.

Of all the things to make a ""new generation sequel"" to, CTA has got to be the weirdest choice.

"I understand that Coming To America was great when you were a kid, but that didn't mean we needed a Disney Channel sequel wtf","You mean, no tittays",movies
"Personally, I thought some of the jokes were good, but this plot felt incredibly lost, like it was burning through premises left and right. And the ones they picked are nothing like the original.

Akeem finds out he had an illegitimate son, so are they going to spend some time looking for him? No, they find him immediately. Is he not going to believe Akeem and has to be convinced he's royalty? No, he immediately believes him. Is him or his mother going to be apprehensive about going back home? No, they come back right away. Is he going to have apprehensions about living like royalty? No, he's fine with it after one scene, down to the arranged marriage. Will trying to mix his upbringing with his royal roots cause any real conflict? No, it's also solved in one scene.

But when the movie *does* settle on a plot, it's not even a ""fish out of water plot"", just the same hackneyed ""arranged marriages are bunk"" story that's been told over and over again. And that's not even getting to all the scenes that are either just modern versions of jokes from the original or literally just repeating clips and lines from the original.

This wasn't a terrible movie, mind, it just felt very creatively bankrupt, especially compared to the original. A classic ""fish out of water"" plot doesn't deserve to get followed up with this mess.",To be fair if prince William showed up on my doorstep saying he's my father I wouldn't ask for proof.,movies

"I can't put my finger on it. The movie is just...there. They don't necessarily recycle jokes, but there is not life to it. Like they bring Louie Anderson back and there isn't a single joke about him. He is just there, working at McDowell's again.

It is essentially the same story as the first one once you get past the finding of the son. I REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLY thought the director of DOLEMITE IS MY NAME would pull something better out of it. I read better plot theories on reddit. 

Also, I think they reshot the end. The trailer has a shot of Snipes shooting a painting of Akeem and there is a action shot of his daughter swinging her head and carrying an AK-47. Neither shot are in the film.","> Like they bring Louie Anderson back and there isn't a single joke about him. 

It's kinda funny to say, but the fact he's still alive and he was just there was enough for me. In the original his biggest joke was he's washing lettuce. While it would have been funny if he was still washing lettuce 30 years later and hadn't made assistance manager yet, they didn't need to waste time on that.

"In what world does Lisa NEED to befriend Mary? I was so annoyed that not ONCE was Leslie Jones’ character put in her place. I felt a moment of sincerity when she was planning her son’s birthday party, but I found absolutely zero redeeming qualities about the character.

"Reminded me of Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. It's not funny, film focusing on the kids, shoehorned cameos, and an overall sad feeling seeing everyone old. James Earl Jones clearly filmed all his scenes alone. I don't think there was a single shot of him and Eddie together.

Just because you make a comment about unnecessary sequels being bad in an unnecessary sequel doesn't make this good.

Why does every straight to streaming film have to look like digital crap? Put some effort into it.

The makeup is still amazing. The de-aged CGI is better in this than in Star Wars, but it's still noticeable. I feel like it works better on black people than white people because Samuel L Jackson is the only other black actor to be de-aged and that look good. Will Smith in Gemini Man was also good until the final scene but that was an entirely CGI creation not just putting dots on the actor's face.","I didn't mind James Earl Jones' contributions lol, he's 90 years old *literally*. But not only were his scenes alone, he might not even have gotten out of bed haha. Like one of them is literally in a bed, and the other he could've been lying down and they just CGI'd it to look like he was standing.

"So, you make a sequel to Coming to  America, some thirty years after the original. In between the original and the sequel, James Earl Jones voices Mufasa in Lion King and when you reference it you don't use it with Jones, you use it with Snipes?!? Really?!?! I don't know why this upset me. It would have been an obvious easy joke, one that's even eye rolling and yet it bothers me for some reason.

With that out of the way, yeah, the movie was rather disappointing. It's not the worst Eddie Murphy sequel, but due to it being the sequel to what might be his best movie, it hurts more. It has a few good laughs and a handful of gut-busters. I've seen people complain about long-overdue sequels being nothing but nostalgic fan-service cash grabs and while I don't always believe that to be the case, it certainly is with this film. 

I thought for a majority of the film that Lavelle was not going to end up being Akeem's son, only for that to not happen. I think it would have been a lot funnier for the Shaman to have gotten his visions all wrong and that the boy was actually Semmi's, who if I recall correctly was trying to get laid in the original. 

And poor Lisa. She was one of the biggest parts of the original film and here she's basically background dressing. I think she has like 4 minutes of screentime in total, most of it being her argument with Akeem in the bedroom. And I REALLY wish they would have cut back on the cameos. 

That said, the honestly best subplot of the movie was Lavelle's relationship with Mirembe. The movie had so many subplots it almost drowned it out.

The movie should have also been called Coming FROM America. There's also a surprising amount of CGI in the film. Like, there's a ton of it - from the animals to the sweeping vistas of the kingdom. Credit where credit is due, both the CGI and makeup effects/costumes were well done.",">And poor Lisa. She was one of the biggest parts of the original film and here she's basically background dressing. 

You know what pisses me off?  

The fact that Lisa so readily accepts Mary.  

Yeah, Mary is from Queens, but if you had a hand in raising who would presumably be the next ruler of Zamunda (and there was *literally* no reason for her to have ever believed otherwise), you'd be pissed at someone sweeping in from literally out of nowhere and stealing your child's future.

"You know we all just wanted to see eddie murphy and arsenio hall be fish out of water again. Yeah it would be a rehash but who cares?

Eddie tries to build a normal life but this time for real since he is broke. Bulk of the comedy happens here. Eddie and aresnjo dealing with a changed ny 20 years later.

Eventually Lisa takes him back when he truly has no kingdom. A call back to the first movie when he is willing to renounce his crown.

Then optional either the movie ends or there's another part or sequel where is daughter decides to go back and try to retake zamunda from wesley snipes.

"It had some okay moments, but they are overshadowed by disappointment and some outright bad writing.

Why do we need to make Jones a date rapist in order to retcon the first movie? Besides the troubling idea that male rape (*let alone any*) is still played up for laughs. It's just unnecessary when the first movie gave you a perfect premise to begin with. You have Semmi bragging about being a prince and is fucking women in '80s America. Just use that as the jumping off point! Then at the end you have the big reveal and we find out ~~Snipes~~^^^^^mybad Arsenio is actually the father this whole time.

Also, the movie wants to be feminist/woke but this lady is **still** jumping on one foot? And we in Africa now so it's *progressive* to have Jones be a fucking warlord because when Americans think of Africa they think warlords and child soldiers. 

Basically the movies main problem is it's made by people stuck in 1980 who haven't upped their comedy game & still think the kind of jokes that would have landed in 1980 will be funny in 2021. And a lot of the premises of how Coming To America is taking the focal point/introspection of having Africans exploring the American black community is lost in Coming 2 America which just plays up terrible tropes of what Americans think of Africa/Africans. 

Since it's free on Prime, it is still worth a watch and does have a few genuinely funny moments. Just don't expect much from the movie. If you had to pay for this I'd say skip it.

I knew the main players were in this, but I wasn't expecting so many of the supporting cast from the first film to return. Mr McDowell and his restaurant manager, the major-domo with the golden mic who sings in falsetto etc. The moment they appeared I was like 'Holy shit!'.

And I know people have complained by the number of song and dance routines, but the song choices are inspired. It's some creepy Spotify algorithm time capsule shit; they're not songs from the era the first film came out in, they're songs that the people who grew up with the film would have been listening to in their teens.

The film was so lazy and shallow that I wish I hadn't watched it. Akeem went from quoting philosophers in the original to saying absolutely nothing of note in the sequel.

"I liked it fine, a good sunday afternoon movie, better than I thought it would be.

The thing is, I feel like the original was set up so well to make an \*organically\* feminist sequel  and instead we got a movie that tried to teach us about girl power but didn't show it enough, I don't know. Like, honestly I would've been so interested in an 18+ rated comedy about someone like Imani or Bopoto becoming friends with Akeem's daughters and discovering her personhood while on a trip to America with them or something. Also, Lisa came from Queens, why did she look at Lavelle and Mary's behavior like they were some strange creatures with a weird foreign culture?

There were too many plots, like they had the option to make the movie about one of many things and instead they chose them all: movie about woman wanting to become queen in a country where it's forbidden, Akeem meeting his son/remembering his time in Queens, american boy exploring life in Zamunda, *Grown Ups*\-like nostalgia trip, etc. and it ends up becoming not quite any of those things.

I thought it was going to be referenced again about how he wants to work for what he has or something but it never did. I don’t really understand why they even added that part to the movie.

"This was enjoyable and definitely worth a watch.  

It isn't an all time classic like the original, but it was still funny.  ( This movie grades at a  B compared  to Coming to America's A+) 

 The jokes mostly hit, and there were several cameos that were perfect - The Trading Places reference and cameo had me coughing from laughing so hard.  

*the complaints about ""woke"" aspects of the film are tiresome - Seems like they come from people who think cancel culture is real - The original movie was technically ""woke"" - A future  king turns down a beautiful but subservient princess for a feisty intelligent and independent civilian woman.","If it was good it wood be okay, but it’s not. It’s just cringe. Anything new is out of touch and just not funny. I forgot all of the characters’ names besides Akeem and Semmi. They constantly referenced the old film with nothing original. The villain was so easily defeated and the plot really didn’t make that much sense. Everything moves so fast it’s hard to keep track of. Why should we feel bad for Akeem’s son if we barely got to meet him? Why is he going to Zamunda and leaving Queens with some random dude he just met? Why is there another McDowell’s reference instead of actual character development? Why is there another dance sequence? It felt like a musical at some points. Much less believable than the original.

Every movie can have an agenda, but when it’s slammed in your face, it turns into Star Wars The Last Jedi. None of the characters serve a purpose besides filling a “funny” role in preaching a good agenda. Regardless, this “wokeness” doesn’t excuse the film’s awful qualities. It felt like a cringe white suburban comedy, but in Africa. It’s only better than those films because it can ride the coattails of the original. Extremely disappointed with this movie. Either it’s a cash grab by Amazon and Murphy, or Murphy was just surrounded by way too many yes men.",movies

Also, I really expected the scene at the beginning with Colin Jost to come back full circle, when after enjoying all his spoils, Lavelle would be berated by a poor kid about having everything handed down to him by his father.

Nice-ish movie, definitely agree that it had Disney channel vibes to it, but that's just a sign of Eddie Murphy's changing comedy, I can't blame a guy for trying something new.

But damn was it full of cringe product placement. Again, I understand it's an economic necessity for movies, but damn, I miss the good old days of fake-brand parodies making fun of popular products.","Yeah but Dolemite which was Eddie with a different director was not disney channel at all, it was a solid R movie with old school Eddie and people loved it.

Perhaps it was award-baiting, but is that a terrible thing when it’s been out for long enough to not qualify for awards anymore, ya know?",movies
"I'm not sure if I buy your argument that Will Smith has suddenly turned into a paycheck actor. 

Look at his Rotten Tomatoes record: his last two films received critics' scores of 77% (""Bad Boys For Life"")  and 76% (""Spies in Disguise"") and his previous star vehicle that broke 70% was ""Enemy of the State"". 

What does that tell us? That Smith has maintained his status as one of his biggest, most beloved movie stars in the world while leading predominantly mediocre films. He and his team have a very clear notion of what concepts will sell and typically execute them with B-list filmmakers (Alex Proyas, Andy Tenant, Gabriele Muccino, Francis Lawrence, Peter Berg, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, Peter Landesman, David Ayer) or A-List coming off box office disappointments (M. Night Shyamalan, Ang Lee, Guy Ritchie). These are filmmakers less likely to challenge Smith and less likely to challenge his ideas or persona.

If there were any point in Smith's career when he clearly sold out, it was his refusal to kiss another male actor in ""Six Degrees of Separation"". Smith might have been right that the kiss could have damaged his leading man credentials at the time, but it was a weak choice and disrespectful of his cast members, his director (Fred Schepisi) and the story that they were all telling. 

If you want to point to a major blunder, it was taking four years off from 2008-2012 to try and make his children into stars. Tom Cruise had blown up his career with his behaviour on the ""War of the Worlds"" publicity tour - angering Spielberg and his home studio Paramount in the process. Cruise was trying to run another studio and it was unclear whether Paramount wanted him back for the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise. There was room for Smith to muscle out Cruise as the number one film star in the world, and he had options: he was linked to projects by big-name filmmakers Steven Spielberg (""Harvey"", ""Flowers for Algernon"" and ""Old Boy""), Christopher Nolan (""Inception""), Ron Howard (""Colossus""), Adam McKay (""Uptown Saturday Night"" opposite Denzel Washington) and Quentin Tarantino (""Django Unchained""). Some of those missed opportunities were his fault while others weren't, yet it is clear that he failed to strike while the iron was hot and returned to the same B-list filmmakers. Cruise, on the other hand, has mostly returned to his place as the premiere action star due to the renewed interest in the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise.","Well put!

Since it was supposedly kind of a sister film to it I was really hoping I would like Some Kind of Wonderful as much when I watched it but I just didn't. It felt kind of like an empty exercise to me, just Hughes being mad about having to change the ending to his other movie so he went and made the same one again.

The weighty or sad parts are so inane, they made us laugh out loud. The dialog, plot, and action are predictable, if not outright tedious. Yet, the bad physics provide nonstop surprises. It's the worst physics movie we've ever viewed. It's so bad, it's almost entertaining.

Man I miss this website

> It seems that 32 Bostonians have simultaneously dropped dead in a ten-block radius for no apparent reason, and General Purcell wants to know if it was caused by a covert weapon. Of course, the military has been put in charge of the investigation and everything is hush-hush.

> Without examining anything, Keyes takes about five seconds to surmise that the victims all died from malfunctioning pacemakers and the malfunction was definitely not due to a secret weapon. We're supposed to be impressed, but our experience with real scientists and engineers indicates that when they're on-the-record, top-notch scientists and engineers won't even speculate about the color of their socks without looking at their ankles1.

porting over the comment from your other post:

Star Wars is Science-fiction-fantasy, so while things like hover cars are just standard science fiction ""might be possible in the future"" type stuff, the Force is pure magic. 

But Star Wars didn't try to just blatantly get things wrong. in The Core, they directly state that earth's magnetic field shields it from EM radiation. That is just a lie, really, the two things have nothing to do with each other.","Actually the magnetic field does shield Earth from the sun's radiation, and the Earth's core is responsible for that",movies

Gonna be hard to find someone to pull off a good Alucard.  Imo the American voice actor they had for both anime series(dubbed by Crispin Freeman) really sets a high bar.

"I don't think this is going to work very well. Although the characters are well fleshed out in the manga, so that's not the problem. The problem is that the movie can only adapt the first few manga's at best.

It'll play well with the vampire theme but the book quickly turns into an anti-Nazi thing. That'll still play well but then it plays into an anti-Catholic thing and that won't play well. This is particularly true towards the end where you have >!white-hood-wearing Catholics invading London with babies being beaten by Nazi zombies!<. This plays well in the manga and the anime but not really in a live action film that's meant for all audiences. Even Berserk would be more mild in comparison.

The adaptation would only focus on the vampire component and it might touch the anti-Nazi bit with the Valentine brothers but that's where it'll end, perhaps on a cliffhanger of The Major clapping in the shadows.",I feel like this needs to be a 2 part movie. I don't feel like they can effectively cram everything into 1 movie without it feeling rushed.,movies
Reading all the comments makes me wonder if it is generally accepted that the abridge is better..,I think its mostly that the abridged is how a lot of people found it and is much more readily available for repeat viewing(I'd be lying if I said that the official and abridged character weren't mixed together a bit in my mind at this point).

"Just finished it and absolutely fucking loved it as well. Random thoughts:

I'm a big Carnahan fan and a bigger fan of big dumb fun action movies in general. If you've seen the Carnahan flicks that fit that genre (Smokin' Aces, Stretch, A-Team) and liked them, then you'll probably love this. 

It's totally a ""turn your brain off and enjoy"" flick. The plot is preposterous, but it's fun because it never takes itself seriously (looking at you, Fast & Furious franchise) although it *does* surprisingly manage to get quite serious and heartfelt at times. I also appreciate how...immature some of the writing was. Lots of dumb one-liners.

I love Frank Grillo (I genuinely think he would have been A-List if he was around in the 80s/90s) and am always glad to see him headline. Also good to see him use a little of his range.

I'm also one of those people who appreciates seeing Mel Gibson work. There's at least one fantastic jab at his past in Boss Level, and some of his own lines seem self-directed.

SFX was above par for a mid-budget streaming original, considering how much of it there was.

Overall, just an absurd, absurdly-entertaining action movie that IMO could end up a cult classic.",Great write up. I agree with all these points.,movies

"This was better than I thought it would be. I love the time loop genre so I appreciated they skipped the part where the character slowly realizes what happens. There’s not actually a lot of action but a lot of dark humor. Frank Grillo really made this fun to watch.

I didn’t quite the ending though. He has to redo the day one more time to escape the loop? But if he dies then it’s permanent?","Just finished it as well. My head canon (which is entirely not explained in the actual movie but it’s my theory) is that Roy had to end the repeating first and THEN they could shut the machine off. 

I think that’s why the world keeps ending after a while, because he’s not there to merge with the machine and shut it off so it blows up. 

After the events of the movie, he’ll have one chance to get back to the machine and shut it down for the stereotypical happy ending.

He probably does and everyone is happy.

Now what am I basing this on? Pretty much nothing so I’m open to theories but that’s the only one I can think of that would explain why the machine kept ending the world and why his ex wife would let him reset with the machine at the end of the film. 

Rot wakes up on his death day and his wife fucks with the machine, putting it into an endless loop/an alternate branch of reality that restarts every day until closed. Roy is killed. Each time the day restarts. Again and again and again. Eventually, Roy ends the repeating. Roy restarts his death day for real this time. Roy has to save his wife before she is killed. They can shut the machine off.

Or he just keeps repeating over and over again and they take the time to figure out what else they need and we just don’t see it. 

Either way, good movie and try not to think about the ending lol",movies

Mel Gibson this year, between The Fat Man, and this movie, kinda feels like the old gritty Mel Gibson.","Yeah at first I thought they kind of underutilized Mel Gibson but any more screen time they gave to him would’ve taken away from Frank Grillo (or made the movie longer than it needed to be). It feels like they wanted to because he had deeper motivations for his actions than generic bad guy but I’m ultimately fine not getting that background fleshed out.

"The HULU version apparently is missing some scenes from the overseas cut while clarifying the ending with an added scene. I'm basing this off of the French Blu-ray that was just released a few days ago.

\- When Ventor (Mel Gibson) tells Jemma Wells (Naomi Watts) to sit down on the couch, in the HULU version it just cuts to the bar scene with Roy, Alice the hygienist, and Gabrielle the French bartender. In the French Blu-ray version, Ventor joins Wells on the couch and tells her a story of a feral hog that chased him while he was in Burma. When the hog was about to attack him, a python grabs the hog and suffocates it. He tells her that the python did it out of necessity to protect the future of its kind. (4m12s)

\- In the bar scene, when Alice leaves Roy and Gabrielle to use the bathroom, Gabrielle jokes with Roy that he could bring Alice to Gabrielle's house for a threesome. She says that it would be fun but that's all it would be. She tells him she could tell in his eyes he's still in love with someone else but there's also sadness because he longs for her. (1m3s)

The HULU version does have a few lines that clarify the ending with an added scene.

In the French Blu-ray version it goes like this:

Ward: If you return your mass to the core, you may not make it. You may cease to be.

Pulver: Well then, give me a kiss and tell me you love me.

Pulver goes inside the Osiris Spindle tells Jemma to wait for him then the movie abruptly ends.

In the HULU version:

Ward:  If you return your mass to the core, you may not make it. You may cease to be. Going in there will likely kill you and you have to repeat the day one more time. And if you die then, there's no coming back.

Pulver: Well then, give me a kiss and tell me you love me.

Pulver goes inside the Osiris Spindle tells Jemma to wait for him. There's an added scene where Pulver wakes up one last time.

Pulver (VO): Okay, asshole. Just don't die this time. Piece of cake (winks at camera).",Yeah I got the very end wink at the camera scene.,movies

But yeah the ending made no sense at all.. and when I Google “ending explanations” none of them actually address the question of how he wouldn’t just repeat the last day again.,"The more I think about it, the more I just think they fucked up the explanation or didn't care to elaborate and wanted to end on a cheeky note. Here's my theory and it's just what I would do as a writer to pave over the plot holes. 

Since it's not explained, let's say the machine works like this: You need a person to go into it in order to go back to a set date and time in history of their choosing to reset/restart the timeline from that point forward. 

The machine requires generic material in the spindle and the host body at the controls. These two things have to match so it can go back to the date and time chosen and implant the new day's memories into the person via their hair and DNA. (How does this work? Who the fuck knows? Movie magic)

If the genetic material and host body are there, we're good. It goes back in time to the point they chose. You can prevent 9/11 or whatever.

If the genetic material is there but the host body isn't, the machine can't compute what to do, doesn't know where to go, overloads and the world resets to moments before the genetic material was put in originally, as if it were an accident.

To an outside observer, this process looks like the end of the world as we saw it several times. Let's say it happens at the same exact time every day (4 p.m. for example.)

Roy was meant to die that day in the original timeline but his wife threw his genetic material into the machine at 7 a.m., starting this process. When Roy dies the first time, he can't get to the machine at 4 p.m. so the day resets. 

From that point on, every time he dies or every time he chills with his son, the clock hits 4 p.m. in that timeline and the world ends.

Because his hair and his DNA are in the machine, he retains his memories of the events prior to the reset. It's like a coding error.

On the final reset day, Roy wakes up and gets to the lab in time to kill all the bad guys and enter the machine before it resets and kills everyone. 

Now he gets to choose when to go back in time and he chooses the day before as a starting point. From there on, the timeline resets and we're in a post-movie reality.

If Roy dies here, he's dead. If he gets to his wife and kills all the bad guys again, he'll find himself in a scenario where he realizes he has to keep going back into the machine over and over and over again because his wife keeps putting his genetic material and DNA in it. 

So, what's he do? My theory is he realizes one loop after we close the credits that he fucked up. He completes the loop but, this time, he goes into the machine and goes back a tiny bit further. Say 5 a.m. instead.

He calls his ex wife, tells her what's going on and instructs her to proceed exactly as planned but this time not to put his material into the machine, to put an empty container or nothing at all. 

He lays in bed until his 7 a.m. screaming alarm clock wakes him up, he completes the program as planned and they live happily ever after. 

Or he dies jumping at the helicopter. Either way, movie over.",movies
Something I’m noticing is that most people think the movie doesn’t show us his final run but it does. He gets hit in the head and killed right before the camera cuts to black. Wish we could’ve seen another run because I think the end was definitely the weakest part of the movie but I still found it enjoyable.,"I double checked the scene and it feels a little lazy, he's lying in bed and winking, whereas the intro scene at ~1:13 has him with his head up before lying back down and the machete contacting against the head of the bed

Anyway 1:26:09 is the ending, 1:26:10 is a repeat of the 1:13 scene and 1:26:11 continues from 1:26:09 but he's meant to be semi-getting up from bed but remains lying in bed (he also never fully winks) and goes lower into the pillow....

before we get the same thunk sound effect of the machete thunking against the head of the bed like at 1:13

so it's a little bit of lazy editing/VFX to the ending scene, but it's meant to be pass over his face identical to the starting scene

Not reading to avoid spoilers but was it as good or better than guns akimbo?,"IMO it's way better. Guns Akimbo felt like it was trying to hard to be ""extreme,"" to the point where it honestly started to hurt my head.

Boss Level is very much a Carnahan action movie. If you've seen and enjoyed Smokin' Aces, The A-Team, or Stretch, you'll enjoy this. It's dumb fun action that never gets too serious.",movies
"Not gonna lie, i saw this shameless self promotion by Frank Grillo https://www.instagram.com/p/CL-wKiQFVZl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link and decided to watch the movie!

It was a fun movie reminiscent of ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" i know it could of been better but i didn't over think it. 

Pandemic, silly shoot em up that doesn't take it self too seriously!

This cracked me up in the movie:

>!""you shot me with hitler's gun?""!<

>!shoots assassin!< 

>!""this is for the jews""!<","Lol that Instagram post is actually pretty funny. The post is by the Rock who apparently will repost any TikTok video of somebody drinking his own tequila brand, Teremana. I thought that was a pretty funny way to poke fun at that while also promoting their movie. It’s a little bit of Frank Grillo having fun and The Rock poking fun at himself.",movies
"Joe Carnahan has only missed one in my eyes... with Stretch...

This movie was great! Anyone else think Pam (Meadow Williams) was Karen Gillan at first, though?",The first scene initially made me think of Jennifer Jason Leigh,movies
Lourd was hilarious in Booksmart. I’m excited to see her here too!,Was great in Scream Queens too,movies
"I liked parts of it, but honestly it felt like it tried to cram too much in. The scene in the funeral home felt extremely odd and I thought the ending felt flat.",That funeral home scene was absolutely fucking bonkers with how casually it was treated. Good movie overall but a little disjointed sprinkled with some questionable decisions—most notably that fucking funeral home/casket scene. Only saving grace was how quickly they got out of there.,movies
"I liked it overall and thought it was well-done. But it did feel kinda mean that the soccer player tripped the mascot and his wrist was injured as a consequence, and the other Moxie members thought that was fine. On screen, his worst behavior is not speaking up when Mitchell takes his co-chair's seat and trying that ""mermaids and pirates"" greeting. He certainly had a lot of room to improve and he wasn't an ally, but it didn't feel like he deserved an injury when his most notable trait is making bad puns.",Agree with this. His character felt like the English teacher but the only difference is he got injured and had to laugh it off which I didn't love in the climax I thought they could've dropped that storyline,movies
"I watched it on Wednesday, I really enjoyed the movie, I really like that the movie was gleeful, provocative, unapologetically feminist. On the surface, it is light and decently funny but is powered by righteous anger about bullying, and worse, of women’s mistreatment in general.

With that said, I kinda glad that this movie is less cliquey and felt more united compared to the other teenage movies and it touched the intersectional feminism, but at the same time, I kinda wished they explored intersectional feminism further, especially when the conflict arise between Vivian and Claudia on how feminism affected them differently, mainly how the stakes are different for Vivian and Claudia, since Vivian is a white girl compared to Claudia who is the daughter of immigrant and she has more stakes compared to Vivian. And that conflict resolved much quicker than I expected. This also happen to some conflict like the her conflict with her mom, that I also think that the movie could delved into it.

But, I would say that the Climax of the movie still worked for me provided me the catharsis that I need. Eventually, there are are some flaws that stopped this movie from a great movie, but I think the good outweighs the bad and I think it is still pretty good movie for me because I am not sure if everybody will like the movie but I am pretty sure that people who like the movie felt that the filmmakers heard their voices.

Note: I think the movie can came across as heavy-handed for some people. For me though, the movie itself is more hand-holding than heavy handed, especially for the people who just started interested feminism, power, and activism. What I like about it, it is pretty on the nose on the feminism so it can spark an interest for the people who kinda clueless about this. But with that approach, I do not think it will work for some people.","The thing that got me to love the movie despite all the flaws you mentioned (and I agree with) is the thought of me watching it at 13. It’s so easy to look at now and see how it’s just Baby’s First Feminism, but to be fair as an intro to these ideas it’s great! I absolutely loved all the characters and it would have meant sooo much to me to see these girls on screen. I actually teared up when Lucy kissed the girl from the soccer team! I can’t even imagine how amazing that would have been for me to see. Maybe I wouldn’t have suppressed my sexuality for 26 years. And Seth!!! He was an amazing love interest and probably the best one I’ve seen in a teen movie. This movie has flaws, but I think it does a ton more good than bad and I’m glad it exists for today’s kids",movies
"I didn’t think the movie was particularly good, but I had a good time watching it. It was so hamfisted that it felt like a YA movie (and maybe it is?) — and if that’s the case it achieves its goal — but it could have benefited from more subtlety. There were still some fun and heartwarming moments though. Nico Hiraga was likeable as hell as Seth — I’m glad they made him an ally even though he might have been a little too long unflawed. 

With all that said, I will conclude with this: Fuck Mitchell with a stick.",It's based on a YA novel.,movies
"It's always uncomfortable when you more or less completely agree with the politics of a film, but cringe at the way those politics are being expressed. 

I didn't particularly enjoy the film, but I was impressed by the supporting cast. Nico Hiraga especially seems like he's going places, and I see a bright future for Alycia Pascual-Pena and Josie Totah as well.",I think of it like this. I really want my 13 year old sister in law to watch this. I e known her for ten years and I'm so happy this film is here to teach her something important.,movies
"The film has its flaws, and is certainly no Mean Girls—which I’ve seen some critics compare this to.  But it was enjoyable and a rarity  in a teen film where they showed guys being the assholes/bullies, instead of the girls ganging up one another, and that was refreshing and made it more realistic imo. One scene where Vivian is scared by a couple of guys as she is leaving the gym from the pep rally, something so small and anyone could easily forget stuck with me. For some strange reason, Hollywood likes to keep the trope of “girls are the bullies in school”, while the boys are seen as clueless himbos to the HBIC to their Regina George in these kind of flicks. I don’t think Hollywood realizes how much boys are the ones doing the bullying in schools to the girls, just as much as girls do to one another.",Also the stereotypical jocks and popular girls cuz it just dose not get teen life down any movie that has teens in it or about high school is not accurate Hollywood dose not care for realistic shit anymore I don’t think they ever have and movies like this will stay the same I feel bad it gets young kids excited for being a teen,movies
"I was initially hesitant about this movie, but my wife eventually talked me into it because she said ""it looks right up my alley"". Boy how right she was, I really really dug this movie in so many ways, not the least being I STAN AN ASIAN LOVE INTEREST!!!

The movie is very unsubtle and definitely not for everyone, but it worked for me. I love me a good coming-of-age story, this time with a strong feminist twist, which is something I personally had not seen before. I thought the punk aesthetic was very unique, especially with all the music choices. The empowering and optimistic tone throughout was so much fun. Liked the aside about Claudia struggling with her strict Asian mom, as well as the diverse cast; there were so many mixed-race actors.

Had minor gripes with where the story goes... mainly the funeral first date which was cute but man what a *weird-ass* choice, and the double-couple dinner fight scene which felt forced, a predictable ""insert 3rd act fight with mom before finale"" story beat. Despite any flaws, I was totally invested in the characters and won over by the end. 8/10

I've been seeing some criticism on Letterboxd that the movie should have been from one of the side character's perspectives, namely one that was bipoc.  IMO this criticism is misguided. The movie is from a white girl's perspective because the author of the book is a white woman, the director is a white woman, and the two screenwriters are white women. Do we really want a bunch of white woman telling POV bipoc stories, not having lived the experience themselves? They can only authentically tell stories from their pov, which as it is, is white. We can argue all day about having more diverse stories, but those diverse stories need to come from diverse creators and writers. It makes no sense to want *this* particular movie (based on a book) to be that. Instead we should be elevating other diverse creators and source material.","> I've been seeing some criticism on Letterboxd that the movie should have been from another girl's perspective. IMO this criticism is misguided. The movie is from a white girl's perspective because the author of the book is a white woman, Amy Poehler the director is a white woman, and the two screenwriters are white women. Do we really want a bunch of white woman writing POV bipoc characters, not having had the experience themselves? 

I agree that, criticism is kinda misguided. Plus I think Vivian's perspective is interesting as a white woman, and she kinda learn the concept of intersectional feminism from Claudia, I kinda wished that the movie had time to explore that.

I also think that if people want this movie from Lucy's perspective, the filmmakers had to rebuild the movie from the beginning.",movies
"I get that the lead being bland is kinda of her character, but it feels like this was a movie made for Amy poehler, someone who can play this role and give it lots of charm (basically Leslie knope lol). Makes sense that poehler directed this. Hadley Robinson is just kinda...there. 

And yea, the movie is heavy handed. I’m hardcore left, and I kinda eye rolled at this. It doesn’t touch booksmart, which deals with this kind of young “woke” (I hate that word lol) messaging in a much smarter and clever way.",I didn’t really find the lead to be bland at all? I thought she was great,movies
"Overall this movie was fun to watch and I liked how it navigated some stereotypes

PROS:

+loved the cast. the chemistry was there and the interrelationships felt believable and genuine

+Claudia: I had a feeling she would be portrayed as slower to the Moxie movement but glad they showed she had to do things her way which is equally commendable

+Seth: so much love for this character! Support and consent we love to see it. My only qualm was the funeral date that had cute high school first date vibes amidst cringe circumstances, overall still cringe

+great soundtrack

CONS:

-I liked what Claudia said about having external pressures due to race and touching on Vivian's privilege. This movie largely devoted time to sexism and sprinkling of racism comments. I get that it wasn't the main focus, but I do wish it just had more time because we have a great multicultural cast

-on the same thread it felt like some characterizations were rushed like how Lucy and Amaya kissed (this goes nowhere) and how CJ is trans. I just wanted to see more zine articles about LGBTQIA+

MISC:

•I hated Mitch, his annoying friend, and Shelly. I'm glad the story didn't try to save them and share ""misc tragic backstory that explains why they are shitty"" to get sympathy for viewer. These characters did annoy me like an itch though which was probably the point of their characters. There are people that won't change but the best we can do is hold our head up high and not feel responsible for them

•didn't care much for Vivian LOL I get that she's supposed to be the character you can put yourself into, but I felt more emotionally moved by the supporting characters","I was so worried Seth was going to be a douchebag in disguise like most movies do. And in the end the message would be ""your girls are all you need"". So glad they didn't do that.",movies
I was expecting this to be below average but the ending was quite impactful to me. Very cathartic ending and enjoyable throughout,"Yeah me too, the ending felt cathartic for me and it still worked even though the movie has few flaws on addressing some of the feminism issues.",movies
That ending was atrocious. We didn’t get to see the result of anything. Was the vote a legitimate vote? There was implication that it might not have been. Did the comic book villain bad guy football captain face any serious repercussions? I’ve been sent to the office for something as small as hair code so that doesn’t mean much. Did the principal have a change of heart and/or lose her job? Will they get suspended? Did the best friend get unsuspended? No answers at all.,"I wanted to see a scene with the female soccer team too, yeah we didn't get the answers to all of above",movies
"Very, very hamfisted as most people seem to agree. Not much humour or charm, just pure activism.  Kinda odd ending. The new girl who inspired her in the first place is woefully underdeveloped by the end, she probably would have been a more interesting character tbh. Solid 4/10!

 However I got a good chuckle everytime Schwatzaneggar son showed up; almost everyone else looks youngish passable and he looks like he stayed behind bout 9 years. Not sure about that casting.",I assume the auditions were a bit easier for him. It‘s Hollywood after all.,movies
"This movie generates 0 laughs and the message is stale retelling of woke twitter stuff I've heard a million times before. There is not a single funny line in the entire movie and it does not provoke any reaction other than, for me at least, yelling at the screen, ""I get it already!!!""

The feminism in this movie is too white and liberal. The black girl character is much more interesting than the main character who finds love with a boring ""woke"" boyfriend. She has an actual conflict with the white QB boy bully. The protagonist finds out about oppression through the black character getting harrassed by the bully and her moms secret cool past. There is not a single substantial anti-capitalist, pro socialism/communism line in the entire film, just rich white men bad. And I wholeheartly agree that rich white men are bad. They mention intersectionality twice but don't do anything with it besides showing that both black and white boys can be sexist jocks. The moxie zine is almost completely devoid of critique besides calling the main bully an asshole. 

The school is one dimensional. There is only one teacher and one principle. During the pep rally they couldn't even fill a high school gym. Only got enough extras for one side. Opening scene at  the high school was bland and slow. The music not used in a cool way at all. There is near zero depth to any of the actual high schoolers. Everyone is very straightforward with no complexity or contraditions/irony. The bully is bad. The jocks are typical jocks. The girls are good. The boyfriend is an ally. The biggest character arc is the teacher who seems neutral at first, but eventually sides with the girls. The biggest issue we get to see our protagonist fighting back against is girls being unfairly singled out for dress codes which is a real thing but it is not presented in an interesting way. Then they throw in that the bully QB committed a rape at the end and his only punishment is that he gets taken to the principles office- cut to happy dancing at the end. Amy Poehler as the cool lib single mom is annoying. Lives in a big ass house in an inauthentic portrayal of a single nurse mom who has seemingly no issues other than her daughter bothering her boyfriend. It appears she has given up on smashing the patriarchy. Now she just bothers the workers at the grocery store.  She used to protest a lot when she was younger. But protest against what? Or how? They never say. They do show that she has an NPR tote bag.

Almost 2 hours long and boring throughout. This movie has nothing to say other than catchphrases and virtue signaling. Also not a single rap song in the entire movie. I'm pretty sure teenagers listen to rap music. This movie is clearly written by an old white woman. 

&#x200B;

0.5/5 Stars","This is the best review ive seen for the movie. The ending is so abrupt despite the bloated runtime.

"the part where Claudia yells at vivian because she is a ""coward"" felt so weird. Like stfu claudia no one forced you into that office.

This movie is just another example that old people need to stop writing young adult films unless they actually understand pop culture.",That was so dumb. There was no need to own up to it.

It's about a Native American man - played by Depp, which, yeah, *oof* \- who agrees to be killed in a snuff film in exchange for a bunch of money that he can use to spend his last days living large. It's meandering, directionless, pointlessly depressing shit with no visual style to speak of, and Depp plays the main character as if under heavy sedation at all times. (And this was 1997, *before* his decline.)","Lost River was great. I was originally pretty disappointed that budget limitations kept them from exploring the “lost river” aspect of the story, but I think it kept it just grounded enough to not be fully fantasy, and more unsettlingly on the edge of real life. The setting reminds me a bit of the first Mad Max; nearing the collapse of normal society, and just teetering on the brink of madness. Sure, it’s based in Detroit, which itself is rather dystopian in a lot of places, but the Bully and the weird cabaret theater really give the setting an ethereal feel.

"While the CGI toons look absolutely fantastic, it saddens me that Warner Bros. has no idea what to do with these characters other than putting them in live-action/animated hybrid movies where humans are the focus of the film, in this case, the riveting relationship between LeBron and his son.

Warner Bros. have squandered the Looney Tunes property for decades and have no idea how to handle these characters. They tried making them anime superheroes, stuck them in a horrible boring sitcom, then we got one of the ugliest cartoons ever created (Wabbit), and with HBO Max's Looney Tunes Cartoons, they've made some shorts that, while being deliciously violent and somewhat capturing the LT anarchy, are closer to Ren and Stimpy than Looney Tunes.

The closest we've got to the Looney Tunes actually acting like themselves was Looney Tunes Back in Action in 2003 thanks to the involvement of Joe Dante (who actually understood the characters) but even then the studio had to come in and make a mess of things, completely changing the movie's plot and adding fart jokes. At least the spirits of the Looney Tunes was preserved, thanks to Joe Dante.

Looney Tunes deserve a fully animated movie focused 100% on them. If the studio allowed people who understand these characters to write and direct the movie, you'd be able to have Looney hit once again and the characters would rise from the depths of cultural irrelevancy and be the animation powerhouse they once were. 

What's even more frustrating, is that WB had a small spark of common sense in the early 2010s and actually produced Looney Tunes shorts that captured the magic of the characters flawlessly. These short-lived CGI shorts done by Reel FX Creative Studios were the best revival these characters have had since the originals and pretty much the only time they've acted like their classic, iconic selves since the 50's. Those were PERFECT, and the most genuine the Looney Tunes have been since their classic Golden Age shorts. 

Here they are available on YouTube:

[Flash in the Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbYO16VsfQ4)

Seriously, these shorts are magical, on par with the classic Looney Tunes shorts. They capture the characters perfectly and translate the traditional animation techniques to CGI flawlessly. Warner Bros. should've continued down this route...

...but Warner Bros. are absolute morons who don't understand their properties, worse than Sony.","Horrible boring sitcom? The Looney Tunes show is the most underrated cartoon I know because it is generally fantastic. It's the best interpretation of the characters. Please watch past the pilot. To get a grasp of the show's humour, I recommend you watch the merry melodies. President day, Long-Eared drifter, Chintzy, Parade float, I could go on. 

Please do yourself a favour and listen to Giant Robot love. It's only 2 minutes of your time!",movies

From the article, there going to be some WB film cameos when Lebron’s fictionalized version of himself gets sucked into the servers!!

[Update: more photos released here](https://ew.com/movies/space-jam-a-new-legacy-first-look/)

[Synopsis:](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/12/space-jam-a-new-legacy-plot-summary-microsoft-video-game)

>Basketball champion and global icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside timeless Tune Bugs Bunny. When James and his young son Dom – who dreams of being a video game developer – are trapped in a digital space by a rogue AI [played by Don Cheadle], James must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the AI’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of basketball stars as you’ve never seen them before.","I hope all of what we’ve seen of Space Jam 2 is an elaborate ruse that will result in the Looney Tunes getting sucked into the world of Mad Max. Give me war boy Taz, damn it.",movies

"I honestly don't see this movie doing well. Looney Tunes were way more culturally relevant in the 90's than 2021. Back then everyone was wearing Looney Tunes t-shirts, had Looney Tunes wallets and was sleeping on tweety bird bed-sheets. Michael Jordan was one of the most famous men in America and maybe the world at the time. 2d animation and real life hybrids were more popular back then. This seems like a soulless cash grab and Lebron just trying to copy Jordan instead of doing his own thing.",Now you don't want to mess with adults wearing Looney Tunes shirts.,movies
Fuck LeBron only political when it doesn’t hurt his wallet,I take it the Uyghurs will not make a cameo appearance in this movie,movies
Gonna do well in China,Well on one hand LaBron loves China but on the other China is still extremely racist. We'll see i guess,movies
"This movie is gonna be such trash smh

Edit: after some back-and-forth on Twitter I’ve realized that this film is clearly being made for the new young generation and I’m just disappointed not enough is being done to market for the fans of the first movie.

And people forgot about it in a week. 


A guy that'd sell his own country and family for more money is the protagonist of a kids movie. He'll spout some bullshit about integrity and love during the movie and then tour China for the premiere where integrity and truth gets you killed. What a hero.",movies

Another way that LeBron is inferior to Michael Jordan surfaces...,This is a fantastic comment lol but lebron fans would like to know your location.,movies
">According to Coogler, whose brother Keenan is one of New Legacy's screenwriters, the project's long gestation period gave them time to find their own take. ""The general idea was the examination of Black fatherhood and how fatherhood could be unique to LeBron James specifically,"" he says.

Ah yes, exactly what everyone wants out of a Space Jam movie starring the Looney Tunes!",Lebron James the only father in the world,movies
"Man, the Looney Tunes aren't even traditionally animated? My interest in this has somehow gone into the negative.",they will be 2d in loony tunes world & 3d in our world,movies
LeBron is a China-cock sucking limp-dicked pandering piece of shit human that is taking advantage of dumb people with ludicrous ideas that he does not even comprehend.

I wish that we could replace him in that helicopter with Kobe.,"i’ve never watched basketball in my life (except for the first space jam movie) and had no idea who Lebron was until couple of years ago and i only heard of Kobe when he passed but what makes LeBron deserving of you wishing him death? i’m not judging you, i’m just wondering.",movies

jordan would never be swept",This is why the silly premise of the first one works. The idea was...the reality was Jordan can't lose. Even to beings from another planet. We've seen Lebron lose multiple times to a couple of light skin niggas from earth. How am I supposed to believe he can defeat other worldy beings,movies
"That’ll be a skip from me, plot sounds like shit and they have the most overrated hypocrite blow hard taking over for a legend.",taking over for GOAT*,movies
"I really wish Hollywood would commit to pushing out new IP’s instead of using old ones. Tbh, I don’t think I’ve watched anything produced by Hollywood  for months now.","They see anything innovative as too much of a gamble.

"So the cover for EW shows 2D models of the Tunes but the movie it is 3D models. I don't understand that kind of thinking right there.

"Lame, so is it going to be like real life where in a close game so LeBron decides to sit and pout with 3 minutes left in the game, then blames losing on daffy and bugs",Nah the refs gonna blow a bunch of phantom calls for lebron and the monsters will file a grievance,movies
Why do we have to keep remaking movies? Is it really that hard to come up with a new idea?,"Yes. Creative writing is almost dead it seems. If they ain't making shitty unwanted sequels to old movies, they're remaking old ones with a gender/race swap of the main character.

Should have got MJ like the original,Or went with a different sport entirely.,movies
"I saw “Lola Bunny” trending on Twitter because of course, and I looked to see what people were saying and all of a sudden my timeline was filled with avatars of anthropomorphic animals complaining that they took away her sexuality. Like god forbid, they tone down the sex appeal of a cartoon rabbit in a children’s movie lol",This new generation can't make up its mind. They praise Cardi B for WAP but don't want women to be sexualized in any manner. Im surprised the new Lola doesn't have ass injections and thigh tats,movies
COME ON AND SLAM,AND WELCOME TO THE JAM!,movies
"Wait, it's not Toon Squad?",It’s always been Looney Tunes,movies
"I’m pretty sure my kids barely know who bugs bunny is, if they do at all.  I’ve been a parent for 11 years and there’s never been any new WB media featuring those characters 

The movie is going to do well because of Lebron and I’m guessing the other NBA stars making appearances, and that’s all good I root for people to succeed.

But I kind of feel the cultural relevance of Bugs Daffy and the gang is long long gone. 

To be clear I rocked a Marvin the Martian hat in high school in the 90s so this is not a hating on WB thing

Edit: ok so people are pointing out there has been some new WB toons.

But when I was a kid that stuff was on all the time.  Especially all the racist and sexist stuff.  

If you don’t have little kids then you don’t know—trust me there’s close to zero awareness of Bugs Bunny among the Gen Z set.

If you were watching Boomerang in college getting stoned watching it I totally get that haha","Cartoon Network: The Looney Tunes Show (2011–2014)

Boomerang: New Looney Tunes (2015–2020)

HBO Max: Looney Tunes Cartoons (2020–present)

Direct-to-video: Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run (2015)

Plus, aren't the original classic shorts in perpetual syndication? I didn't grow up with new ones, but the old ones were on every Saturday morning. I was an adult by the time the successes of the Nike commercials and Roger Rabbit inspired WB to get off their asses and make new ones.",movies
How will the movie poster look when this releases for the Chinese market?,Hopefully they replace lebron with winnie the pooh,movies
"Nobody:

That CGI Bugs Bunny looks amazing. That alone's got me pumped for this.,"Yet people in ITT are complaining that the movie is geared more toward children, like the first one was geared towards us, as children. Not sure what was expected.",movies
"This movie is going to be garbage, like the first one",The first one was terrible but also amazing,movies
"The movie is gonna end with James on a barely lit court by himself doing some warm ups and you’ll hear a voice say “heard you’re the best, show me”

Who would dare question James’s status as the best...James turns around.

"The original took a very popular athlete at the time and used him for an hour and a half to basically sell shoes. Frankly if they were making a Space Jam 2 I'd rather see them branch out on that original concept instead of just copying it. Basketball isn't the huge ""in"" thing like it was in the 90s, maybe use Michael Phelps and it's a swimming competition instead. Or ...uh, what athletes are popular nowadays? xD I don't think Lebron is the big in thing atm.",Ben Roethlisberger and it's a football game,movies
Please tell me r Kelly is doing the soundtrack,He'll send it in from prison via a zoom call.,movies

And yet, I am not a humorless person by any means. I LOVE a good joke or a raucous comedy or play or a great stand-up routine.

A single baby is more likely to stand up in their crib and cry when they are bored.","We are super lucky. Our big one (just about 3 now) usually is quiet for about an hour after bed time. Then she wakes up and holds court with her stuffed animal friends. She reads to them, sings to them, has detailed conversations with them.

Had a ""gonna cry"" moment while we were potty training. She had just gotten the hang of peeing in the potty a couple days prior. We hear her say, ""oh no, Ducky, you peed the bed! It's alright; I love you so much. Let's get this cleaned up.""

After she mastered pooping in the potty, we heard, ""Ducky, you pooped in the potty! Yay!!!  ... ... ... Wow, that's a big turd!""

Fortunately, both situations were fully imagined. No fluids or solids in the room 😀",funny
"""You should have kids!""

*has twins*

""I didn't mean all at once!""","Lol. I have a friend who has 4 boys.  After the first two, her and her hubby said ""okay lets have one more - maybe it'll be a girl"".  Nope TWIN boys.",funny
"I mean, these kiddos seem pretty smart.  I'd be impressed if they were my kids.",Well they’re not as smart as me!,funny
I love how they had one final conversation before going to bed.,"That was my favorite part too! “So, this sleep thing...should we try it, you think?”",funny
"Lol so awesome, they're interacting and hanging with one another, things that will build strong bonds for life.  Cool stuff",I love the last little protest climb out for a minute before calling it a night.,funny
Those kids are going places. Not to sleep but places..,With the amount of sleep they get they'll be well adjusted for college,funny
"This is awesome.... They didn't destroy anything.... They built several forts.... Sat on the couch... discussed the latest baby news... Then got right back to building forts.

They took naps in between.... And talked some more.... Where's the problem?",And they ended up going to bed afterwards,funny
What y'all without kids don't understand is this video is actual speed.,Twins gives 5x multiplier to speed. Turn your back one second... Boom! Ruckus!,funny
If only we could harness this energy for *good*.,Introducing Baby Wheel!,funny
At least they stayed in the room and kept to themselves.  My kid was always coming out and scaring the shit out of me because she had something “she had to tell me.”  Motherfucker you’re 2 years old there’s nothing useful you have to say to me at 3 in the morning and it certainly didn’t need to be repeated after I told you I didn’t care at 1.,Hahaha yes! When you wake up and they are standing there staring at you. Nothing scarier.,funny
"Man, that just makes me want to be a kid with no job who stays up all night having fun.","Imagine waking up at 2am, sitting on your sofa, feeling badass",funny
"As a twin, i can tell you shit like this is why my parents only ever had me or my brother.

My mom's favorite story to tell anyone who would listen is the FIRST time a cop dropped one of us off at home... we were 2 years old at the time.",Do you know which one of you it was?,funny
"I will tell you that there’s this moment I experienced with triplets where the lack of sleep made me start to question reality. You’re up and down so many times at night, you’re getting maybe 3 hours of intermittent sleep. It’s like the moment when Neo finally sees the Matrix. I remember taking my daughter back to her crib and simply admitting to myself that none of this could be real and that maybe I had already died. Like in death you just keep on doing the same thing without realizing you were dead. My brain was basically mashed potatoes by the time they finally started sleeping through the night. I do not recommend having multiples. I love them but it’s so hard to function without sleep.","Lmao not exactly a ringing endorsement for children. 

“Reality and time meant nothing to the point I thought I was dead”",funny
Those baby cages need lids.,Nah once they can climb out it means you should switch to a toddler bed.,funny
Childless heathen here.  Why r no make crib with lid?,"That's called a ""cage"" and it's frowned upon to keep kids in one for some reason",funny
remarkable how you thought just putting everything back and putting them in their crib would totally stop this,"Some of it's tactical  you know the kid doesn't go to bed immediately so you put them down a bit early and let them run around and tire themselves out before retucking them in.

The problem with twins is that if one winds down (which happened in the video) the other one might kick them awake and start the cycle again.",funny
You think maybe the reason the kids can't sleep is because there are freaking droids attached to their cribs? I wouldn't be able to sleep either if Hal 9000 was shining in my face all night.,"Yeah, what are those things? Anyone know?",funny
They’re getting really efficient at that.,Cake day buddies! Happy cake day!,funny
"This needs to be said - with kids big enough to get out of the crib like that, you need to ***stop using*** the crib.

Some cribs allow you to remove parts of the railings and lower the mattress to make a toddler bed. Failing that, you need to get a proper sleeping setup.",I babysat a young child who fell from his escape from crib. Busted his femur into pieces. Had a half body cast for 6 months. Seriously need toddler beds. Or even crib mattress on floor. Accidents happen and the severity can range from minor to death by hanging themselves.,funny
"My twins are 8.5 now. When they learned how to climb out of their cribs, i just converted them to little beds. I figured they were going to do this anyway, might as well go with the flow a little.  Plus, I didn't like them climbing in and out.  One of them fell out as she was coming over the top and banged her head pretty hard on the floor.","At 21 months, it still hasn’t crossed my daughter’s mind that climbing out of her crib is a possibility, but as soon as she does, we are converting to the toddler bed.  That’s a fear of mine, that she will climb out and hurt herself.",funny
Probably because theres a fucking *floodlight and disco balls* in their room.,This is exactly what I was thinking. Anyone with one child knows to whatever you can to settle them down at bedtime. I can't imagine twins and stimulating lights above their heads at bedtime. Good luck.,funny
  As a father of two. I feel this video. I can hear the desperation in dad near the end...”Jesus Christ just GO.TO.SLEEP”,"Samuel L. Jackson reads 'Go the fuck to sleep'

https://youtu.be/SDCqgHLX8Ys",funny
Why is no one talking about the disco balls?,Yep.  Weird flashing lights while trying to go to sleep?  No wonder they wanted to up all night!,funny
"Dad: why are they piling up the pillows?

Twins: our goals are beyond your understanding.",how else will the universe become piled?,funny
"I am such a lazy parent. I would put away the cribs, get them sleeping bags and let them sleep on the flooy","That's better parenting than letting them sleep in cribs that they can climb out of, which could injure them.",funny
"I'm not a parent. If your kid can get out of a crib without hurting themself, isn't it time to not longer put them in a crib? Also don't most of those swap around to a small bed?","I am a parent, and I was thinking exactly this, if they have the manual dexterity and stenght to climb out of the crib that expertly, it is time to move them into a bed. It can be more dangerous to keep them in a crib, as they might slip and fall.",funny
If a child can climb out of a crib they shouldn’t be in a crib. My son was happy to stay in his bed at 18 months old. We have the crib where the side comes off.,Drop side cribs are illegal to sell in the US because they can be dangerous.,funny
"These parents’ lives would be changed if they just used sleep sacks. No need to convert to a toddler bed before they’re ready for it, no need to keep coming in all night, no lost sleep for growing toddlers who really need it.

If they can’t lift their feet high enough to get over the rail they can’t pull the shenanigans being seen in this video. They eventually get bored of just sitting around in their cribs. They actually go to sleep.",Except when they figure out how to get out of the sleep sack. We currently have our 2 year old wearing hers inside out and backwards. She can still unzip it...Luckily we can get to her in the morning before she has it totally undone. She's so close to climbing out and I'm holding out as long as possible.,funny
Shoulda put a lid on those cots,That's called a cage.,funny
I wonder why cribs don’t have a roof.,That's called a cage.,funny
"As a twin this spoke to me.

If you’re going to put up disco balls then you’ve got to expect them to want to party. 

Who are the tall people that keep ruining all the fun?",Same. Joint enterprise is a thing. My mother still has a 1000-yard state when she describes some of the shit we got up to as small children.,funny
Look pretty damn old to be in cribs.,Nothing wrong with a crib.,funny
Im a new parent to twins. Now I'm worried,I’m a twin parent with 3.5 year olds. A consistent schedule and a consistent bedtime routine can go a long way towards reducing events like this. You’ll be fine. :),funny
"You can get toddler sleeping bags, basically a zip up bag with arm holes and it means they cant get that leg over the edge of the cot :)","I have one for my son. I thought it would do the same. He can still climb and run in it. 😒

Good news is I got a solid sleep routine for him. He's never that hyped when I put him to bed (naps are a different story though).",funny
Jesus don’t they ever get tired?,They sure do! And then they get all cranky and challenging all day.,funny
"This is SO unsettling to me. 🤭😆Reason 6,783 for me to stay a crazy dog lady.","I agree, for some reason it really unnerved me...",funny
I am a twin and we did this as babies too. Just wait until one realizes poop can be used as make up and wall art.,"My son at 2 did this,painted from wall to wall and about 3 feet up with poop, by the morning it had dried, so of course we cleaned it but that little bugger was right next to us with a bucket of water,soap and a sponge helping clean as well, he never did it again ;)",funny
"OMG, I got exhausted just watching this.",I too got exhausted. I think they have spent my month's energy in a day.,funny
I've said this before. But the answer to kids getting out of their cribs is pretty simple. It's right there and everybody knows it. It's just that teeny tiny detail that makes it a bed and not a cage.,Lids? LOL.,funny
These two will grow up to be best friends,Engineer best friends,funny
Why don't they have beds already? They aren't little babies anymore.,Those are beds.,funny
I'd just kill myself if i accidently got pregnant with twins. Jesus christ,Definitely look into getting fix then!,funny

My kids use to do the same thing. I put some thin chicken wire around the top of their cribs and hooked it up to a deep cell marine battery. It only took a few times of getting the piss shocked out of them to break em of that.,And here I was just gonna suggest a roof and a padlock,funny
"sooooo, what are they doing wrong exactly? they clearly have energy to burn and aren't hurting themselves or each other. Also, I love how they got down and sat with each other for a few after the second time before climbing into their own beds and going to sleep. How old are they? Twins?","Well, I'm pretty sure the second time the parents came in the one kid was stomping all over the other one. They probably came in because he was crying.",funny
Why do the parents live three houses down and can't hear this goings on?,Who said they didn't hear?,funny

"Is it only me or does it not seem crazy to just leave the  toddlers to fall asleep by themselves?!
I read or rock them to sleep? No someone?!",Until what age?,funny
"Mine didn't do this shit, but I also didn't have twins either. Mine are 18 then 24mos apart. They thankfully never collaborated on their mayhem until they were older. Like now. I'm there shades of fucked. They're smarter than me. And they know it.",">They're smarter than me. And they know it.

Username checks out.",funny
Honestly if they wanna crawl around all night why not just let them? The room is locked and it doesn’t look like there’s anything dangerous in there that could hurt them.,Because they need to sleep according to schedule or it’ll throw off the parents’ schedule and end up with stunted growth for not sleeping enough.,funny
How old are these kids? Not having children I don't really know at what age they become this agile etc.,They are about 2. I think.,funny
"All this happened in a single night? How they have this much energy, i get tired after correcting the bedsheet.",this all happened in the span of 2 minutes lets be real,funny
How old are these kids?!,Around 3 I would think,funny
"while I remember kinda these chanagins, I only remember building chair steps to get maple syrup from above the fridge.  but no way I could have kids.  I could not be a good dad.  just seems like all time is spent corralling them.",“Chanagins”? Seriously?,funny
"Fuck all that, no to crotchgobblins.",I don't really think you have a choice anyway. To have children you first have to find someone that wants to have sex with you.,funny
"I'm so glad that I am gay and so much of a shit show that I can't just accidentally or on purpose make a child, and instead need to completely change my life, become rich, and REALLY REALLY REALLY prepare and jump through all of the hoops to maybe get the privilege and/or torture that comes with being a parent.","When you really want them and love them, they're not ever torture.",funny
I  think these kids are being fed crack and LSD.,i dont think that,funny
Filming your kids' every move and posting it on the internet is creepy as fuck. Don't do that.,Yeah can someone explain to me why they need CCTV watching the kids all the time?  Seems odd to me but I know nothing xD,funny
Why do kids i so many western countries sleep alone? Family bed = best for kids mental health.,"1. babies need like 12 hours of sleep, adults 7-9, that doesnt mesh
2. a full bed of people tossing around kicking each other means nobody sleeps
3. no sexy time if the kids in the bed
4. the kid never learns how to self-soothe and fall asleep alone

Takes 1 or 2 nights to teach a 6 month old to fall asleep on its own and stay asleep and in bed for 12 hours, why ruin your own sleep and create a codependent monster instead?",funny
Haha? Ha ha hahahah? Whats funny about this? The kids clearly don’t want to sleep in their sterile isolation cages. It’s almost as if we evolved to be social creatures,It’s normal for kids this age to do this. Doesn’t matter what type of environment you set up for them.,funny
"The issue is that these parents don't let their kids exercise enough. They gotta waste alot of the energy they have. I know, I know, easier said than done. It's either that or just let them watch tv for that whole time they are up. Something will eventually get them to sleep.",It’s not that it’s easier said than done. It’s that they don’t tire as easily as you might think. They have very short rem cycles at that age and they can power nap for 30 mins then wake up fully recharged.,funny
Why are they in that little room with nothing?,"Well it’s called a bedroom, and they usually aren’t very big. And it’s night time, which is when you are supposed to be in the bedroom. And the goal is to not fill it with stuff that is stimulating. But kids are kids and they clearly find a way.",funny
"-why did the parents feel the need to clean up everything that's just self torture they're only go in my to mess it up again 
-hoping it wasn't the case but kinda looked like the parents might be shouting at them. Hope not","To teach good behavior. Children learn a lot from observation. No, they don't get it now. They didn't get it the second time. But they will if you continue showing them. And if you don't, then you just have a messy room full of things they can easily trip over, and a kid (or kids, in this case) that'll never clean their room because they never saw it being done.",funny
Solution (if you can) operate them into separate rooms.  And they probably had a sugary snack before bed which doesn't help.,"Wasn't that ""sugar makes kids crazy"" myth debunked years ago?",funny

"As a breakfast sandwich aficionado, I purchased one of these several years back.  There are several problems with it:

1) The center ""slide"" has no direct heating element; rather it relies on being preheated before you can actually use it to cook anything(so eggs are mostly a bad idea, and precooking is almost required unless you let this thing ""preheat"" for like 10 minutes).

2) It's really difficult to find pre-formed sausage patties that actually fit this thing at an average grocery store.  They do exist, but you'll likely find yourself making them from ground sausage more often than not.  Bacon won't cook right in thing no matter what, so you'll end up separately cooking that either way.

3) After using it a few times, you'll realize it's actually really a pain in the ass instead of being as simple as the packaging makes it look.  It would honestly probably be easier to buy some rings for your stove and pre-cook all the separate stuff in a pan and just assemble everything hot instead of using this thing.",That's pretty much what I assumed when I looked at it.,funny

He was the lead engineer on a project that finished ahead of time, and like $100,000 under budget.  Which is unheard of but he did it, and he was mostly responsible for it.

"Never stay at a company too long. That’s the golden rule, always lateral or move upward to different companies for higher pay.

3-4 year timeframes are the best before each move, 1-2 is too short and a red flag depending on industry, 10+ years at the same company, you better show internal upward movements and development.","The other way to get 20% raises is to jump into management and be schmoozy enough to make the executive ranks.

"This shit pisses me off, if I have to find another job every time I want more money then I might as well just bloody leave because you obviously don't really value me you just don't want anyone else making money off my work, or you're a greedy bastard.

Either way, you lied.

If the money wasn't available last week then it isn't available now, you lied and you did it to rip me off, I know this because others will pay me what I'm worth but you don't want to even though you have the means and I know you have the means because you just told me you do.

Good fucking bye","Technically they didn't lie.  Having been involved in annual budget planning you have a budget for raises.  You also have a budget for employee retention.  They aren't the same thing.  I could only give out so much in raises, but if someone leaving was considered detrimental at that time I had other budgetary resources that I could bring in to retain them.  That is how the money wasn't in the budget before, and is now.  Also, if you have shown an interest in leaving, expect critical obligations to be transitioned to other people.  That way the company can either choose to end the relationship when convenient, or if they don't and you submit a notice of another offer in the future they don't have to use retention budget to keep you and can replace you with someone for less money.

Another argument against taking the counter offer.  If you did accept it, when I was distributing my allotted budget for raises for the following year, I can guarantee you the amount I was permitted to allocate to someone who needed retention funds was much lower, regardless of their performance.  For instance, if I had to give you a 10% raise to keep you last year, I may be permitted to give up to a 5% raise to any given employee, but you would likely be capped at 2% or 3% this year.  You are still ahead, but your incentive for staying drops off for at least a year.

Also, your manager is also being evaluated based on their results, and meeting their budget.  Retention funds are a nice safety net that can keep them under their annual budget.  If you take a counter offer, you just cut a big hole in their safety net, and now you get to keep working for them.  Management that ends the year over budget get chewed out, management that ends under budget get a bonus.",funny
"Not gunna lie, this is how I got my last 2 raises lol. And as long as my employer doesn't realize there actually isn't an outside offer I'm good.","Keep in mind some will counteroffer to keep you on until they can find a suitable replacement and then let you go. By threatening to leave you've shown that you're an employee who will put them as an employer in a tough spot man-power wise to demand more pay which isn't something any employer wants. Either you're asking for a raise because you think you deserve it or you've found a new position and you're leaving. There's no ""I'd like more money or I'm leaving for this other position"" as that's douchy to both your current employer by putting them over a barrel for more pay and to the other company offering you a position that you're only using as a way to put your current employer over a barrel.",funny
"Same shit.

Sick of $14 an hour for a job that is normally 25-40 except I have way more responsibilities than that standard job role should have.

Asked for a raise to 20 and was offered 30 cents by the end of the year. Any more was impossible.

I find a new job and then suddenly $40 is possible.",Nice,funny
"As someone who's been on both sides of that desk, it really is true. Yes, the company will always leave some 'room' in the budget for unexpected circumstances like trying to retain an employee in this situation, or even stretch their budget to make it happen if necessary, but that doesn't mean they can afford or have budgeted for handing out generous raises to everyone from the get go. You're one of many, and just because this works for you doesn't mean it would work if everyone did it at the same time; though smaller regular raises would certainly be a 'fairer' way to approach it, it would just promote more turnover if you can't counter. Unionize!

I don't have a problem with this tactic if I think you're already underpaid - it gives me ammunition to argue with the higher ups to get you paid what you deserve. It will absolutely make them perceive you as more of a flight risk though, and work to make you more replaceable in case you try it again.","It's nice to hear a perspective that straddles both sides. Thanks for sharing. 

My takeaway is that while a raise is possible in the short-term, the only long-term opportunity for raises that don't alienate management comes from changing employers.",funny

"Here's a 3 year shitshow for you.

I was a manager for a team of analysts, reporting to a director. The higher ups hired another 'senior' manager to sit between me and the director - no team of his own - I apparently now report to him, he reports to the director for me. He also doesn't work in our building, where my team and our director all work on the same floor. Weird, but alright.

So I share a first name with one of the senior treasury people, our VP accidentally emails me his annual budget instead of the treasury. Including all our salaries. My director is only making 30,000 more than I am, but the new senior manager is making 50,000 more than our director, and he has an extra week off every year, and he has no responsibilities. Oh did I mention he doesn't have a performance plan with my director - he reports to someone unidentified higher up apparently. Things smell fishy.

My director asks for a raise since he's been on hold for the last 2 years despite strong performances. They refuse to even match his salary to his subordinate senior manager. So he quits, gets a job within the week that pays him twice as much.

I get a 10,000 bump 6 months later, presumably for not burning the house down and quitting too. But 3 years pass. The senior manager gets promoted to director - he only directs my group (none of the other responsibilities of the former director), and he doesn't work in our building, I have a 30 minute meeting with him once a week to tell him how we're doing. Our clients don't even know who he is, they call me or our VP.

So - I have this great analyst - he's our data guy - he gets an offer from one of our clients for 30,000 more than we're paying him, but it's a 40 minute longer commute. He asks for 10,000 more and he'll stay just for the shorter commute. I think this is a no-brainer, we're underpaying him, he's a star. I tell the new director, he seems to agree. They drag this out for a month trying to get him to void his offer with our competitor - and I lose my star team member from dumbasses trying to hardball a guy holding all the cards here.

So, I write up my letter of resignation. I go chat to the new director, and ask for the same salary he was getting when he had my title 3 years earlier. He immediately refuses, doesn't even pass it up the chain to waste my time. Before he finishes his bullshit, my letter of resignation is on his desk.

I quit, and start my own company. My team fell apart within 4 months. The new director was fired, and his secret boss was fired too (the rumor was embezzlement). Are we saving money on salaries yet?",This was an interesting read. I am 40 and have been at a few different companies and it never ceases to amaze me how much if this crap goes on.

"#NEVER ACCEPT A COUNTER OFFER

If the only way you were able to get what you deserve was to have one foot out the door, that isn’t going to miraculously change if you accept a counter.

The company culture and way of doing things is still exactly the same only now they know you leaving is a real possibility.

A smart employer ensures they aren’t in that position next time i.e. having to extend a counter. They’ll do cross training, etc so that, should you try to leave again (which you almost certainly will) you won’t get a counter *or* you’ll no longer be as “irreplaceable”and if they need to cut people they know where your loyalties lie.

If you’re now making x% more, congratulations! You’re more likely to be let go because your unique skill set that kept you employed has been cross-trained and your more expensive to keep around.

Also, how do you think future raise and promotion conversations will go? You just got a raise! Oh? Don’t count that counter as a raise? Well they sure do!

You made the decision to move on. Stick with the decision that got you what you wanted and go the company that sees your value.

It may not be perfect, but you’re hopefully starting from a place of mutual appreciation.","I respectfully disagree with this as a rule. It really depends on what your current work environment is like and what your relationship is with your employers. Even if your relationship is good, I would actually recommend skipping the first step and start by looking at other jobs in the market. You can then sit down with your manager and start the conversation with ""hey I was looking at other similar jobs, can you match their salary?"". If they decline, start looking for another job and get an offer.

I also don't agree that it puts your job in jeopardy to do this. Remember that you are negotiated based on the offer from another in the same industry. It might be possible to replace you, but it might not be possible to do it cheaper. Anyone they hire might demand a similar salary, and then there is also the cost of training. Also, if you are basing your negotiations on the market demand for your position, then if average compensation for your position increases again next year, you can negotiate again.",funny

Get a job offer and see if you can get a bidding war between the two,"This is actually really unprofessional. If a prospective employer finds out you're using their offer to coerce a raise from your current employer, you're likely to lose your current job and your offer.

Pro tip, dont tell your employer or prospective employers about other offers.  Just consider each offer in their merits and go with the best.",funny
Why do these get 50k+ upvotes? They’re not funny or original. Just lame.,"Agreed. Someone is actually downvoting you, like they actually laughed at these low effort jokes.",funny
Big news that s how negociation works,"That's not negotiation. That's lying. If you asked for a raise and they said no we don't think you deserve that right now, then yes that's negotiation because someone else thinks they're worth that. Saying they don't have the money to pay you more then suddenly they do when you might leave is just being a dick",funny
Nothing odd about this. They needed someone else to set the market.,"They shouldn't need that. If they are at all on too if their business they should know what the market is for position X. And if your making less than that and ask for a raise they should give it to you unless your not a good employee. 

Companies make it so the best way to stay competitive with your pay is to go elsewhere then they punish people for ""job hoping"" it's complete bullshit.",funny
[removed],What a low-effort post.,funny
"This isn't completely how it works.  You are always paid what it takes to retain your services.  No business could ever operate any other way.

There are 2 Nash equilibriums here:

1. Boss gives raises to whomever asks for it, so when they really need to retain someone, they lack the budget to do so
2. Boss gives raises only to people that are valued to prevent them from leaving, which boss would not be able to do if they gave raises to everyone who asked.","Isn't every employee needed and therefore valuable? I've never worked for a company who had excess employees. They just wrung every ounce of work from the few they had. 

I feel it was never a budget issue. Companies have CEOs, owners, and stockholders who are greedy for ALL the profits. When employees rise up against them, everyone suddenly gets a big raise company-wide.",funny
'Giving person raise for no reason' vs. 'making counter-offer to keep employee' would be different budget priorities so yeah this makes sense I don't get the point this is meant to make.,Sounds like you would make a great manager.  The point is the company has the money either way so just give them a raise if they deserve that amount.  They might loose that employee by refusing the raise and if that employee walks they will have to spend even more training someone new. Time will be lost and money wasted.,funny

How is Eminem not the best living rapper of our time?,[deleted],funny
[removed],"You probably think that you have a free pass to be racist because this comic is making fun of white people but here are a few reasons why you’re still an ass hole. 

This comic is a white person making fun of white stereotypes. You’re a white person making fun of black stereotypes. By not belonging to the race of which you’re making the butt of the joke, your joke isn’t rooted in any clever self-awareness, but in a malicious jab only meant to harm and demean.

The stereotypes referred to in this comic aren’t based on a history of oppression and dehumanization. When you post “I love me some fried chicken”, you’re alluding to stereotypes dating back to slavery, and popularized by racist propaganda from hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. These racist roots can be found in the other uneducated and insensitive comments you made. All of these stereotypes have been and are still used as a means of making black people out to be uncivilized and inferior.

It’s not as simple as “what if the races were flipped” and reducing the discussion to that is simply ignoring the obvious and insidious inequalities and injustices surrounding the subject.",funny

Ohhhh don't I Know it. Couple of year back a friends wife had to go into hospital and he asked me to house-sit their cat for a few days. he happened just as he was leaving to say the cat was quite stand-offish and would mostly do its own thing, but it could be ""Quite Vocal""

That evening I'm sat watching TV and from the next room comes someone saying ***""Oh no no no no, no do, way no oh, poor me""*** I froze...  I was meant to be the only person in the house. I jumped up and dashed next door, the room was empty... apart from his cat.

I looked at the cat, the cat looked at me...

Spooked, I returned to the front room, and about 15 minutes later,

***""Ooooh, my my way no poor me...""*** In the weirdest childish song-song voice you have ever heard. I stuck my head around the door and found myself eyeballing the cat suspiciously, and even saying *""Was that you dude?""*

""The red liquid is actually myoglobin, a protein that's only found in muscle tissue. Myoglobin carries oxygen through the muscle and contains a red pigment – which is why muscle tissue is red.

"Watching those really makes me appreciate good film production, filming, editing, and comedic vision to take a pretty-okay initial joke on paper, and then expand on the joke in surprising ways.

Look at that pool skit. Look at how many people had to get dressed for it, how many visual gags they had to film, the number of shots. The fact that it probably had to be storyboard-ed, setup the shot, get the props for that shot, and they needed a good physical actor to perform it. All of this for one overall joke, that they expand on it for 90 content-packed seconds.

Can you imagine being the guy who came up with the idea, and thought it was pretty funny, and then spend hours setting up the film production on bringing the 90 second joke into reality? Wouldn't you start thinking to yourself *""what if this doesn't turn out funny?""*

After a day or two of filming for hours, you go and  whittle it down to 90 seconds. Just to please people for a couple of minutes as they browse their phones this morning.

I don't dislike YouTube creators, but I am disappointed with the ones who churn out content all the time that never attempts to reach as high a quality as this and they don't commit to the joke as much as these 90 second videos.

These Comedy Central shorts will still be funny and rewatchable many years later. Most YouTube  creator content won't.","I don’t know who came up with this idea. It is very similar to this sketch from 2 years ago:

"This isn't true. At all. 

In fact those split level stairs are a relatively new thing, and are usually used to replace ""dangerous"" stairs that you do find in older homes, due to their steepness and narrowness. 

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vqQi5Tl70) does a good job of explaining it in detail. But in short, servant or back staircases in older homes typically had too narrow of a foot bed and too high a rise. It was usually a cost saving measure, but it meant people had to use an unnatural ""gait"" to climb or descend and resulted in a lot of people tripping and falling down stairs. Think about it, you usually climb stairs on ""autopilot"" because most stairs nowadays are standard size, if you encountered an atypical staircase you'd more likely to trip because your autopilot wouldn't account for the change. 

When renovating older homes it's hard to ""fix"" these older staircases, the photo here is one attempt.","The attic in this house was meant to be an attic but the landlord converted it into a proper bedroom but didnt or coulsnt fix the steps. So these steps get SO steep that at one point your chest is brushing against the steps - its basically a ladder, but not. 

So now that you have a good idea of how shitty it is - make it a half spiral. Where it spirals though the steps become thin - as thin as 2 or 3 fingers together. Also, its got that standard older short beige carpet and your socks will slide on it like its nobodys business. 

I full body rolled down these steps until I slammed into the door at the bottom at least 4 times in the 1 year I lived in the attic room. Fell down without the full roll more times than I can count on both hands. These steps SUCK lol.",funny

Is there any particular reason why it is thought that witches can't climb them?,I'm also confused as to why witches would have any more trouble climbing these than anyone else.,funny
I hate stairs already. This makes me hate them more.,We found a witch!,funny
"They are called [alternating tread stairs.](https://salaarc.com/blog/alternating-tread-stair/) The intent is to cross the same vertical distance using half the horizontal distance. You can also make them a bit less wide. They generally come with restrictions on where they can be used and not violate building code. Usually low traffic areas like lofts, attics, and single occupancy rooms.",Also have seen these in multi-floor tiny houses as a space saving measure.,funny
Can't the witch just turn them into regular stairs?,She used all her spells per day,funny

Witches have a vast knowledge of magical qualities and effects that allow them use of a cauldron and ingredients to make potions/poisons and cursed objects. Witches can fly at mach-level speeds on a broomstick and turn into whatever animal they'd like (usually a black cat). Witches have access to all-powerful spells that literally alter the fabric of the universe  with the wave of a hand. But fuck me if you put these stairs in front of them haha,"Maaaaan. I was searching the comments looking for this response. I was thinking to myself ""They can conjure all sorts of spirits, elements, powers; and see, communicate with, compel and instruct spirits and creatures across other realms, dimensions, universes, realities etc; They apparently can summon demons, gods, angels, raise the dead, heal people, curse people, influence people's lives, kill, maim, and otherwise harm people with a totem of someone, or just through a spell or thought; But fucking staggered stairs?

This also works when moving with you reptile and the cars cab isn't warm enough. For example think people with AC in the summer not fully watching the temp, or moving in the winter and the cold is hard to chase away.

I want to know how this happens,"Error in genetic replication. For example, the instructions in your DNA to grow your hand doesn't write out the code to make a finger four times, it does it once, and there's code that says, ""do this four times.""

So when some people have an extra finger, somewhere along the line, the code that said ""four times"" (fingers only--pretty sure the thumb is its own code) got copied as ""five times."" There's supposed to be a village in Africa where that genetic coding got passed around to the point where everyone has it and having six fingers is normal.

So this crab--as some point, the genetic code to grow  a claw got activated at the wrong place.",funny

"Since the man is running on the train, his relative speed from the ground is the speed of the train plus his running speed. So will he in fact land a few feet ahead of the moving train when he hits the ground? If so how much time does he have to get off the tracks? Physics people please feel free to weigh in...","What you are not counting for is negative acceleration due to wind resistance. The train is having to use power to maintain a constant speed, so once the man jumps off the train the air resistance will cause him to decrease in relative speed due to no additional force propelling him forward. Think of when you stick your hand out side the car window how you have to have a lot of force to keep it in the same spot if your hand is open. Now imagine that with an entire body.

"I wonder how much she got paid for that interview.... 

The royal family is an interesting beast, but I wonder what the main motive for the interview was, seeing Harry was much less vocal of criticisms. 

Markel never needed them, and must have known their views from an early stage, but now she is playing the victim on the main stage.  Their alleged actions are hardly surprising (and I’m sure they’re not for her either) given their conservative history, but why cause all the fuss? is it just to defend their decision to leave.  Harry, in part, is causing quite the upset once again, just like the time he dressed as a member of hitler youth for a dress up party, a poor decision from a young sheltered man, but along with other issues it doesn’t surprise me that he is happy to leave, although I’m surprised he is happy to light the fire as he does so. 

Markel from other reports has hardly been a saint either toward the royal staff, so one must look at all things objectively. 

It seems to me she is just cashing in on the drama, using her trade to make the most money possible. 

Given the amount of controversy surround the royal family lately (well done Andrew) I’d be surprised to see them last another 10 years,  or at least be further demoted as they continue to be over the years.","> Markel never needed them

Beg to differ.

Without Harry, her career would have ended with *Suits*, and you'd never have heard the name again.  She is 100% leveraging any drama she can create for her own benefit.

Her kid was never going to be Prince of anything, because he's like 7th (and counting) in line for the throne, and that number will likely sink like a stone, since William has 3 kids already in line ahead of him.  Not to mention the apparent immortality of the current Queen.

Averages are several degrees warmer in winter and cooler in summer, with an occasional day or two of like, -20-22C or 38-40C some years. I recall one year it hit -31C, back in the mid-1990s.

Edit: I can understand if people see this as being a killjoy or gatekeeping fun or enjoyment during a difficult enough time, but I think the minor inconvenience of wearing a mask at all times when you're supposed to pales in comparison to the affect it might have if you don't.

They are not yet at their tables, but because the gentleman in the picture is disabled, he uses a wheelchair to get around instead of walking, which means he's always seated, which means he never has to wear the mask.

To me it's strange that some people still don't get it. It's not a fraud, it's simply public safety. It's not that seated people can't spread a virus but making people mask up when they're not seated means less infections. 

It's better to keep your mask on when seated, but people are allowed to take them off if they choose as they're not mingling as much as when they were standing and they can also eat and drink that way, it's a calculated risk. A responsible person will still mask up in many cases even if the government doesn't force them to.

Clean your scoop man.,"It’s McDonald’s, they don’t clean anything",funny
"I dont have enough fast food experience, whats going on here?","This is only from Mcdonalds experience, dunno if it's everywhere fast-food but I assume not. That's the fry scoop and it's down you fill the bags / plastic containers for frys.

You scoop up the frys, put the base in the container then shake until the containers full. This allows you to do it quickly without touching the frys with your hands.

That's basically it. I don't really get the joke but I guess the joke is that's it's super easy and quick to do but seems to take them forever, which is complete bullshit of course. 

The reason it normally takes longer is that someone at the counter has ordered a crap load of whatever you ordered and your in line or that a bunch of people have ordered the same thing at once or both.




The rest of this is very long but basically it's an explanation why fries is the FUCKING WORST.

Frys are the worst because you get cardboard cuts on your hands then fuck loads of salt enters those cuts and stings like hell. You're normally by yourself whilst every other bit of the store has 2 or 3 people but EVERY CUSTOMER gets frys. 

You're cooking every fry at the same time and burning yourself with the oil a little because of the speed you have to go. In addition you're basically melting because there's a fry vat (normally a big 4 basket fry vat and the baskets are big) as well as many heat lamps keeping the other frys warm whilst you cook them and maccy d's doesn't pay for AC and the shop floors are so small you've got your back to ice cream machine WHICH SPITS OUT MORE HEAT MICHELLE NOT COLD, TAKE YOU'RE ASS BACK TO PHYSICS! 

Finally you're also responsible for filling up the hopper (the thing spitting up more frozen fries for the vats which you attend) with more frozen frys every 5 minutes. This involves running to the freezer in your greese soaked apron and carrying a heavy frozen box back which ensures you never get used to the heat due to FREEZING then BOILING every 5 minutes. 

By the time you've filled up the hopper whilst sprinting there's orders for 10 large, 20 medium and 5 small frys awaiting you. You're face will never recover from the acne given from attending 4 vats of boiling greesy oil and you hate life, plus your fingers sting from the salt filled cardboard cuts I mentioned earlier and oh gosh whys it making my skin BUBBLE?!

Basically fries is hell. Its why they normally look miserable and why we give that job to the newbies for their first month. And also why that newbie usually quits. Maybe it's less bad if your manager puts two people on it during lunch hour but HAHAHA, your dumb ass thinks your boss has people to spare? 3 people quit this week bitch so you better hope your ass can cope with a skeleton crew shift!

All just arithmetic before that. Okey, some very basic geometry in 4th grade, but mostly just arithmetic.

In 8th grade we even did it with different numbers bases.  It was all still arithmetic though. Over and over and over again.  Fucking boring. Just endlessly solving arithmetic problems on paper until the tedium became nauseating. 

No new thoughts. No new concepts. Nothing to challenge your mind at all. Just year after fucking year of needless grunt work hand writing out arithmetic problems.  Its like they really wanted me to hate math.

"When I was in 7th grade my favorite Hostess items were Ding Dongs (chocolate frosted hockey puck looking things with cream filling.) I remember begging my mom to buy them and every once in awhile she would include one of the aluminum foil wrapped treasures in my bag lunch.  One of those rare days I went to retrieve my noontime delicacy and found it was gone!  Somebody had stolen my fucking Ding Dong!

I was obviously upset but that was only the tip of the iceberg, for the rest of the year every time I would bring one of the sugar bombs of goodness with my lunch, no matter how closely I tried to keep an eye on my bag the precious dong would disappear.

Finally the night before the last day of school arrived, my wrath had grown to monumental proportions,  I devised a plan and initiated my dark work.   I opened a fresh ding dong up and surgically cut a small hole in the bottom, scooped out the cream filling and proceeded to pack the empty crevasse with a horseradish and wasabi blend.  I replaced the chocolate plug (even melting the chocolate like a weld) and carefully re-wrapped the confection.  I slept well that night...

The following day giddy but straight faced I waited, and sure enough at lunch time I look in the bag and the ding dong of death was gone...my anticipation was palatable!   Shortly I hear the sweet sweet sounds of vomiting and look across the classroom to see the class douche throwing up into the garbage can, my missing ding dong laying beside him with a huge bite taken out of it.

Someone is hiding the biscuits behind the cokes.,Shhhh! Those are my biscuits!,funny
"fuck clip strips

all my homies hate clip strips",All my homies dump clip strios back on the cage and leave that shit for someone else to hang.,funny
There’s WHS/OSHA guidelines about storing reactive chemicals in proximity of one another.,"Technically speaking mentos and coke don't chemically react at least not to get the effect we see.  The reaction is based on physics. 
  
Basically the mentos has a rough surface that physically provides alot of sites for carbonated beverages to form bubbles. This occurs rapidly until explosion.    
  
That's why the trick works for any carbonated beverage. Even carbonated water.

Just made me want to apply to a supermarket and set it up to actually happen. Might get arrested. Success would be worth it.,You sure as hell wouldn't get arrested for stupid shit like this. Never mind about even other people working in the store giving the slightest shit.,funny
That’s a lot of weight for those shelves. That’s playing with fire.,"Those are ASDA shelves. If you saw the kind of people who shop as ASDA you'd understand; they need to be strong and very, very hard-wearing.",funny
"The thing that strikes me most is the price of the coke. In Australia, the full price of a 30 pack is $39(£21.67, USD$30).    Some size variation is usually on sale for half price but even then we are seriously ripped off.     Its manufactured here, not imported.",The price says 8.50 for a 30pk? That’s literally $6.50 is USD for a 30pk.... that’s a much better place to shop! 12pk here is like $5.....,funny
Is this not an OSHA violation?,In the U.K? They have no power here.,funny
"took me a min to see the mentos, i figured op was talking about those skinny ass shelves with tons of coke on top",Lol yeah that's tempting chaos too,funny
"Most supermarket employees arent responsible for that!

The parent brand of mentos pays a rep to set up stuff like that in all stores in their district.  

So honestly,  *Mentos is temping Chaos.*",Hah the fact that Mentos has chosen to display their sweets there is funny and very clever!!,funny
"Pretty sure this isn't a certain employee doing this, this is in every Tesco's or Asda. I'm sure they all put them there.",Haha that's even funnier that it's the same across the whole board of supermarkets then !! What clever merchandising,funny
