"Snuffles is his slave name, he's called Snowball cos his fur is pretty and white","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",pics

France has Shanty Towns!,"A few years ago there was a sizeable shanty town actually on active railway property along the RER from CDG. I’m sure the SNCF Sûreté have since moved them on, and no doubt with a heavy hand*.

*My only interaction with them was being grabbed by the arm and hauled off the platform at Aix-en-Provence because I dared to sit on a bench and make a phone call in the 10 mins between changing trains. I didn’t know that loitering wasn’t allowed. The provision of benches led me to believe they were for sitting.",pics

"This isn’t the “side of Paris most don’t see”, this was a Roma encampment which went up years ago, was immediately highly controversial, and got torn down just as quick as it went up. Your title makes it seem as if camps like this are common throughout Paris.","Well yes, you kinda need to have a clickbait title.

I live in this city, there is definitely poverty and misery in there. But we don't have large ""favelas"" like some here seems to think.

I regularly see people searching in trashcans in my street.

Big cities are like that. They often underline the wealth gap between people. I think the most impressive contrast I have seen like that was in ... Miami. Homeless people, limos, clubs for the super rich. This was pretty weird. Still this was a small part of Miami and certainly not what represents Miami.",pics
Less sketchy looking than all the encampments here in Austin,"Homeless encampments I’ve seen in North America are very transient in nature. Tents mostly but something clearly created by someone with the assumption it’s a temporary home, by someone who doesn’t know what they are doing and isn’t investing in the encampment or in gathering resources over a long period of time.

These look more permanent, like the people intend to live in them a long time, and they know how to put them together. The authorities aren’t going to come along and kick them out. They are investing in the homes.

The North American homeless population is mostly people suffering from mental health problems and/or addiction. This population seems to be simply poor, but far more capable and invested in their homes. Both are sad. Both seem like societal failings, but I think they serve slightly different populations.",pics

"We have had something similar here in Sweden, but it mostly consisted of EU migrants from the Balkans coming to beg for money in the streets.

If it's the same in France then it is unfair to make it look like it's a systemic French issue and it's unfair to compare it to homelessness in the US.

Edit: I looked it up and it's mostly made up of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania.

Or the lighter mauve line? Or perhaps the one with the lavender hue will rattle me uncomfortably to my destination. 
It doesn't matter, as I am sensually shoved by the throng of Parisian commuters towards one of the Tangerine shaded lines, their coughs and spittle enveloping me, so intimate.

"I agree that at the elementary and secondary levels there shouldn't be an overbearing amount of homework, but there should be an abundance of preparation.  Individual mastery of any subject weather it be critical thinking (math) or memorization (history and English) requires a certain amount of personal practice.  The concept of homework should be focused on this preparation and practice in order to demonstrate true understanding and mastery of a subject.  I don't think that you can TOTALLY eliminate homework, but the concept as to why and what is assigned should be carefully designed to add value to the student's progress in the course.","You're pretty close. The research is very clear that there are two different types of homework. The first kind would be repeating or reinforcing what has already been learned. This is most commonly done with things like worksheets and spelling lists. This type of homework has been shown again and again to be either completely worthless or a very little value. Certainly not worth the time.

The second kind of homework is preparatory. This involves kids interfacing with texts or videos or gathering information or materials that they're going to then use later in the classroom. This might be something like asking a kid to interview their grandparent about what the '70s was like for them and then bring that interview to class to do something with it. Or, it might be something like watching a video about Mars and creating some questions or making a poster about it. The key is that they will then bring those questions or post your two class and do something with them.

That second type, often known as inductive presentation, has been shown to be very helpful for kids learning.",pics
"Counterpoint to this for students at a certain age and maturity level:

Sometimes you DO need to do things yourself, and entirely yourself. There is a teaching experience associated with completing a large project that simply cannot be replicated in an invigilated group.

So I love the message this teacher is sending. But it shouldn't apply to, I'll say, college or university level students in their third or fourth year, where that student is focusing on a career path where their work will often depend on them imposing a structure themselves. They're too close to the point in life where they may have to work in a non-supportive environment and with their own accountability. It should be changed up at that point.

I learned an absolute ton from my undergrad thesis, both about my topic and about myself.","> college or university level students

"Per [here](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/second-grade-teachers-unique-homework-policy-goes-viral/), which also has a video interview with this teacher (i.e Brandy Young).

> **Second-grade teacher's unique homework policy goes viral**

> BY JENNIFER EARL

> UPDATED ON: AUGUST 24, 2016 / 9:20 AM / CBS NEWS

> Every school year, elementary school students are faced with new challenges.

> They have to make new friends, get to know new teachers and learn how to juggle more complex courses.

> But there’s at least one stressful thing second-graders at Godley Elementary School in Texas won’t have to worry about this year: homework.

> Brandy Young, a second-grade teacher at the school, passed out a letter to every parent at a “Meet the Teacher Night” ahead of the start of the school year to explain her new homework policy -- or should we say, no-homework policy

> A pleased parent posted a photo of the letter on her Facebook page, and it went viral with more than 59,000 shares.

> “Brooke is loving her new teacher already!” Samantha Gallagher captioned the picture.

> The mother of 7-year-old Brooke was thrilled to know that her daughter won’t be overwhelmed with homework this year...

> The teacher said homework just wasn’t working for her classroom anymore. So, she decided to make meaningful change.

> “[Students] work hard all day. When they go home they have other things they need to learn there,” Young told CBS News. “I’m trying to develop their whole person; it’s not beneficial to go home and do pencil and paper work.

> Dozens of people praised Young’s view on homework, Gallagher included.

> “Finally more teachers are catching on to this!” one Facebook user commented.

> “Hopefully this will change some things,” another wrote.

> Gallagher is looking forward to the new routine.

> “We’re happy that at the end of a long school day she’ll get to come home and unwind and be a kid... go outside to play, make new friends, spend more time as a family,” Gallagher said.

> Young, who is a parent herself, wants to bring more families together.

> The Godley Independent School District is a district of innovation, following The Leader in Me school model, Young explained.

> “Our superintendent really encouraged us to be innovators,” Young said. “Whether or not it’s popular, I just wanted to see if it would work. You can’t know if it’s gonna work unless you try it.”

> Several other teachers within the district are also considering taking a similar “no homework” approach. And Young is happy to hear it. 

> “For any teacher considering anything that might benefit their students I say go for it; if something doesn’t work, change it,” she said.","It's second grade, who gets lots of homework in second grade anyways?",pics
"Would love to see that research.

Intuitively and anecdotally, homework helps by repetition at the very least. Of course, it wouldn't if you don't do it. Or if you cheat, or do it in a really half-assed way.","There’s heaps out there, and likely specific to whatever country/culture you’re in. 
What you’re talking about is basic, repeatable skill kind of work which shouldn’t be a large part of learning anyway.",pics
"Do countries held to be the best systems in the world also have a no homework policy? Seems a pretty strong counter to this statement. For example, Japan and South Korea have homework. Finland doesn’t have homework but it’s hard to say they’ve been an important contributor to global policy.","Japan and South Korea have really different social constructs when it comes to schooling and work ethic (compared to Western cultures like America, UK, etc). Homework should work because more learning is good but it would have a different level of effectiveness depending on how it's acted upon.

Broad generalizations here but, I'd say a student in Japan is more likely to see homework as additional learning taken seriously as a chance to study and improve, whereas a student in the UK views it as something to be done as quickly as possible (if at all) before they can move on to other things.",pics
"I have seen this idea first hand with my nephew and nieces. One is in a district that does not do homework and the others get homework sheets. Same grade, my brothers raised their kids similarly, the difference in their ability is huge. Especially in math and spelling (basically all they’re doing at that age). Poor guy has a really hard time with multiplication tables, while the others blow through them. I really believe that practice with homework sheets is needed.","Don't confuse a natural ability with homework.

Difference between correlation and causation.

Algebra is very difficult for some and hard for others. Math is a language, and if you don't grasp the foundations of math, you are forever lost.

No matter how much you push into a person, some things they will be worse at then others.


Teachers matter. Periodt. Some teachers merely pass students along while others educate. Again, correlation is not causation. 

Last, it depends on the student.

There is no correlation nor causation between failing and homework. Or not doing as well in certain subjects over others.",pics
"This is bogus. No research? There's decades upon decades or research on memory recollection and how repetition drives memories from short term into long term. Memory is like chiseling a stone. The more times you drive the chisel into the stone, the bigger the dent in the stone, the better you will remember said material. Whether it's reading similar material in a book that the teacher talked about or doing similar math problems 30 times in a row. 

&#x200B;

If you want to destroy American public education even further, then adopt this ""no homework"" policy. All these people who claim ""it never helped me at all!"" simply don't know what they're talking about and don't recognize it did help them in school. 

If I spend **an hour** telling you how to take apart a car and put it back together, give you no homework, and then give you a test on it a week later, how well do you think you'd do? 99% would fail because there is no learning that can take place in one, one-hour session about a topic. You need hours of repetitive learning over days and weeks to retain detailed information. It's all about repetition and ""no homework"" destroys this.","I agree with you on the repetition part, however the time to do this should not be in the hours after school. The schedule should have time slotted to do the work.",pics
"So if you do nothing in school, you have homework to do. But they say that homework isn't productive?","They didn't say homework isn't productive. No, they said assigning ""homework"" for the sake of homework isn't proven to do anything additional to the classwork. If you skip the classwork or fall behind you get to take it home and make up the work so that the classwork can keep going on pace.",pics
"I never understood homework. I have always believed, whether I was in elementary school or college, that an instructor who can’t manage to fully teach a subject during class is not worth a shit and should be fired. And the teacher is right, family time is far more important than another needless assignment. Writing assignments with due dates a week away and tests on the covered content seem fine to me. Allow the student to study the subject on their own, but don’t require it.","It puts way too much responsibility on the kid to structure their own time. You think a kid who doesn't want to do homework is going to voluntarily plan out independent review of what they learned each day? If they do, guess what, they created their own homework assignments.",pics
"The most educated man I know is an unusually-highly-educated teacher.  Multiple PhD's, lots and lots of degrees (including several in education), been teaching around the world for decades, highly sought-after and paid serious money by top schools to teach even way into retirement.  He now usually gets paid enough to move to a country, teach only for a year, live off that money in that country for several years, get married, get divorced, move country again and then get another teaching job (which is usually a case of just going through his inbox and choosing from the hundreds of offers that get sent to him ALL THE TIME from everywhere from Singapore to Kuwait, the US to Europe).

One private school that hired him saw such a HUGE increase in his students in just a year that they literally accused him of cheating the tests - so he asked the entire year group to re-sit their exams, just for him (and his students love him, so they all said yes, and their parents all could see the change in their kids, so they all supported him), the resit paper was set by an entirely independent teacher, it was monitored and invigilated like a full examination, and the students all got... exactly the same high results.  (He then resigned in protest at being insulted, but that's besides the point).

He does not set homework. It's a nonsense. Always has been.

And I'm very fortunate that he's my ex-father-in-law and is currently home-schooling my daughter (who has gone from average state primary school to a private school abroad in a matter of just a few years of living with him - and the school fees were paid for because it was one of the conditions of his taking the job, so they were paying him a top wage far more than all his peers, relocation allowance and visa to a foreign country for him and his immediate family, a fully-funded school place for my daughter and then gave him whatever he needed to fund his teaching).

Homework is not teaching.  Teaching is not homework.  Teaching without a qualified professional in the room to analyse, gauge, and pitch their lesson in the right manner is a nonsense (by-rote teaching is therefore a nonsense).

And I say this as someone who worked in dozens of schools for my entire career, not as a teacher, and is the mortal sworn enemy of all teachers I meet.

Homework is a nonsense.  If you want to set homework, make schools 9-5 instead.","My husband is an educator and he agrees with this, especially with little kids. The only situation where he can agree with homework is if the child is struggling in a topic, then it's up for the parent/ guardian to assist with homework and work with their teacher(s) to help get up to speed.",pics
"This would work for my four year old who is currently in his first year of school. Granted, he is doing his homework by himself, saying sounds and coming up with words that start with that letter and trying to recognise sight words. All I do is read to him daily. He loves books. I don't think it's necessary for four year olds to have homework. He is so exhausted from school.","Wow, that is crazy. Sad for your kids that they are requiring that.

"I’m confused, when did teachers start assigning homework? All my homework was always what we didn’t get done in class","As a kid in the 80s, the amount was completely teacher dependent but I dont think there was ever a standard placed.

"I call the years of irreparable damage caused by homework ""The Homework Wars"".

Night after night of fighting and being punished over and over and over for nothing.  I didn't get bad grades because I was stupid or didn't understand the material, I just didn't want to spend my evenings, the little free time I had to be a kid, doing bullshit work.  But my parents correlated my value as a person to my ability to complete homework assignments.  It was awful.  It's great when you're a child and you just want to be a kid on those beautiful summer and winter evenings, but you are constantly reminded what a disappointment you are because of it.  Yet you watch your classmates get straight A's not because they are the smartest, but because they complete the work.  

Fuck homework.","This sounds like a very long way of saying you were lazy and resented those who put effort into self improvement. Effort *should* trump natural ability. I find it weird that you're trying to spin it like they were less deserving of As than you.

You got bad grades because you were lazy. You clashed with your parents because they put value in self discipline and work ethic and you were too lazy to do those things. 

Guess what? Nobody likes working. Everyone wants to spend their carefree evenings doing bugger all. However, people sacrifice their time to achieve self improvement and guess what? Others value that because it is a productive and positive trait.",pics
"It's important to note that schools will have a fixed curriculum of topics and targets for learners to go through and if on higher edy then that can be mandatory in evidence based work.
For children it is important to give them skills and learning that will hopefully inspire them in their lives and develop interests in learning and what they like.

While yes any work going home not done in school would still be home work, I think it's more based at having just the curriculum and not additional work set just so that homework is set.
That study would fall apart if learners did not do the work in school because that would be the only school directed learning they are getting.

I teach post 14/16 and I set homework, but I set activities rather than worksheets and ones that match the subject such as identifying what plumbing systems a person has in their home, what type of boiler, even what type of heating system layout, etc ( I teach plumbing ).

Homework can be beneficial if it's actually useful, unortunately too many teachers set it for the sake of it and don't consider how it can improve learning because they're just meeting a school policy of target.","Also, the study published on homework outlined that high school students, and only 1 maybe 1.5 hours assignments and no more.

"Nice teacher but comment above has a point. If you struggle and don’t do anything throughout the day, you have homework? But homework has not been proven as correlation to success. So that doesn’t fully square.","That's because your second consideration is incomplete. 

Here's the actual point: Homework has not been proven as correlation to success WHEN IT'S OVER AND ABOVE A MINIMAL LEVEL OF IN-CLASS WORK. 

OTOH, not doing the work at all has absolutely been proven as correlation to not being successful. 

This treads middle ground. You have to do a minimal amount of work to be successful. (Yes, exceptions like buying your way through life because your parents are billionaires apply.) So if you don't do that minimal amount of work in the class, you have to do it out of class.",pics

Not to say, of course, that holistic learning doesn't have its place (or that Japan does a good job in fostering critical thinking compared to the West) but it has to be grounded in that more structured approach.","> why countries like Japan run circles around Western countries in math and science performance?

Are you sure it isn't because they literally have to test into middleschool and highschool? There are literally cram schools to prep you to get into highschool.

Kids that have issues learning simply get pushed out of school.

On top of ...? I thought the top of Kilimanjaro is above the tree line and no plants like that found there.,"As [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrosenecio) can tell you:

Dendrosenecio (Giant Groundsel) is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family.... Its members, the giant groundsels, are native to the higher altitude zones of ten mountain groups in equatorial East Africa...",pics
"If they are currently alive, how is it they are said to be 'prehistoric'?","Sometimes evolution hits a sweet spot and mostly settles in for a million or so years. Crocodiles, those bacteria that live in underwater lava vents, crabs, etc",pics
Quick someone smoke it,.....you read my mind.,pics
Founf? With been living with them for lifetime 😄,"Found not  only means ""discovered"" but can also mean ""Can be found"", as in the location where they typically are",pics

 They look a bit odd. what else makes them prehistoric.....?,"All plants are prehistoric.

There are some ""living fossils"", plant and animal species that have barely changed over tens of millions of years, but giant groundsels are a fairly new species, only around a million years old.  But ""prehistoric"" gets more upvotes than ""weird looking.""",pics

Looks like one of the cousins allrdy moved in the 70s,somehow everyone looks in a different era based on the clothing 🤣,pics
Was the 90's Vietnam's disco era?,"I think so, but 90s is probably the end of it. I'm not sure what's classified as disco exactly but I remember when I was 3 or 4, which was 1991-1992, my older brother (19-20) took a picture with a bunch of his friends, most of them wore bellbottom pants. It went out of style just a couple of years later I think.

It started much later than the US probably because Vietnam was sanctioned and isolated. There was hardly any influence from Western culture. It was my brother generation who started to listen to music like ABBA, Beatles, Elvis, etc.",pics
Looks more like 1978.,"hahah yeah totally!! They haven‘t moved to Switzerland by that year though, it was after 1985.",pics
OP? Are you sure of the date. I mean I was 23 in 1990 and them clothes look anachronistic.,"My dad doesn‘t remember the exact date, maybe between 1985-1990. Also, he mentioned that his choice of clothes were mostly disco-based",pics
So cool! What city is this from ?,in Zürich 😊,pics
"What was their experience immigrating to Switzerland like? How large (or small) was the Vietnamese community there? I’d be interested in seeing how they balanced Vietnamese and Swiss culture... like, how would you make phô in the middle of Zurich?","When he came over, there was a small community (around 3k-5k). There were none Vietnamese Restaurants, they would cook at home and eat together. He was sent to a language school to learn basic German, he later applied for jobs and worked with other Swiss. He would learn their ways of living and basically his cousins and him were really close. They‘ve actually never been discriminated, Swiss people were really open-minded.",pics
They cool,happy cake day!,pics

Can we talk about that roof cap system? Am I correct in assuming the black plastic is venting for the attic space? If so, what keeps rain out of the vents?",This angle makes it look more flat it’s actually quite steep so it’s hard for rain to get in,pics

I kinda like the idea of the decoy.  Means the police are interested in slowing down speeders rather than collecting fines.  The double ruse copception gambit is hilarious though.,It's probably because people learn of the decoy and think it's just a decoy,pics
When the sun hurts your eyes through the only untitnted window,Heh you said tit.,pics
What is happening in this picture,A cop is hiding behind a decoy police car.  The decoy is used to scare drivers into slowing down but drivers get used to the decoy and ignore it.  Hence a real cop is hiding behind the decoy to catch the driver who ignore the decoy.  Sneaky bastard,pics
What's the point?,"Probably put the cutout there for a while giving drivers time to realize that it is a decoy and to ignore it. Now the actual cop is hiding behind it,presumably with a radar gun, waiting for driver to be complacent and ignore the decoy so that he can pull them over and meet his quota.",pics
The old double bluff.,Little do the drivers know there's just a mannequin in there. Triple bluff.,pics
What is the logo on the facade for?,"Its to fool drivers  into thinking there's a real cop there.  This would make the driver slow down.  The thing is common in eastern Europe.  Having said that,  drivers get used to the decoys and speed anyway....but here the cop is a sneaky bastard


Edit.   Lol I misread your question.  I thought you wrote logic lol",pics
"Anyone else think it's wrong that cops lie in wait for anyone who may be operating just outside the rules of the road so that they can ticket them?  It feels like a public fleecing in my area.  There are cops everywhere hidden away so that if you go over the speed limit for even a second, they are there to take advantage.  

I don't speed and have no issues with this, but it just seems like an odd way to operate.  Are they protecting the public or exploiting a steady income stream?  Why are there so many cops in a rural area where crime is very low?  Do we need a cop car in every high way U-turn?  

It's really annoying and makes me feel oppressed.","This would get thrown out of court in many countries for just that reason, it's not how the police are supposed to operate in ""free"" western countries, laying in wait & setting traps. Ultimately it's self-destructive for the police as they lose the respect & cooperation of the very people they depend upon for info to do their job.",pics

Each individual color/shade itself took about an hour or more. Then after varnished.

Didn’t use any tape, all freehand but I did sketch a design on once it was primed",pics

Do you need to use a specific paint to do this?

"The cake is vanilla with blueberry compote filling and a vanilla swiss meringue buttercream!

The wave design is made out of wafer paper. Wafer paper is a thin sheet made out of potato starch, and is flavorless. To colour the wafer paper I used gel colours mixed with glycerin and painted it on.

I had traced the original artwork in AutoCAD and divided it into 4 sections based off of colour. I then plotted each section to my Cricut Maker to have it cut out of the wafer paper.

I used clear piping gel to ""glue"" all of the layers together to create the final image 🙂

"I am more surprised we dont have drones patrolling factories.

More coverage and faster then you have recharge points all over the place.

To make them work you have proximity sensors scattered around the area. If one area gets very hot with movement, you dispatch drone(s) to investigate the areas, a security guard gets an alert and reviews the drone footage. Say access is authorized or not, if not, the drone(s) continue to follow the areas with hot movements.

Now the question is if we have that many proximity sensors, why not just have the normal cctv?

The khanate was never recognized as a state by any countries and eventually the Russian Reds won out and set up the Mongolian People's Republic, which eventually _did_ get recognized and is the direct antecendant of today’s Mongolia since communism ended in 1992.

- The vaccines weren’t stolen from Australia, AstraZeneca is behind schedule with their vaccine deliveries and the doses that were bound to Australia have been relocated to make up for those delays. Also they were relocated for the EU common vaccine pool, not for just us greedy Italians 
 
- Even if they were stolen, this man has no power in the decisions about those topics, they are competence of the prime minister and his ministries",pics
Maybe Italy should start thinking about some shortcuts to speed up their painfully slow and mismanaged rollout.,Italian vaccination results are better than EU average,pics
"Too much focus on ""optics"" today and what ""looks right"" instead of doing the right thing. Presidents are more important than regular people.","President Sergio Mattarella is very important and Italians know that, but the value of each life Is the same for each Citizen, from the president to the last inmate. This is also in the costitution and is the reson why Italians don't have death sentence.",pics
"cause he's only the president. In Italy, the Cosa Nostra's bosses got the vaccine even before it was discovered",Easy to generalize.  As if I regarded Americans as a gang of fat guns.,pics
i thot italy had a king tho..,Unfortunately we haven’t had a king since 1946 ;(,pics
Is every countries president old as fuck or is just USA and Italy?,"He's the president (head of state), not the prime minister.
Prime ministers are usually much younger.",pics
"While this seems so virtuous, it's actually stupid and dumb. Why do we make believe that all people have equal value in a society? This guy is the PRIME MINISTER. Which private citizen is so haughty to think that they are more important to the people of Italy than the Prime Minister? Why can't we all grow up and realize that we give certain individuals more responsibilities, and thus they become (albeit temporarily) more valuable to the society than others?

To all the idiots who believe otherwise, take this basic example and think about it: if you were making a wedding and only budgeted for 100 people, would you only let in the first 100 people to register and screw your family, friends and inlaws? Really? Come on, man.","> This guy is the PRIME MINISTER

No, he isn't. It's right there in the title. They are not the same thing and they are not the same person in Italy.

>Which private citizen is so haughty to think that they are more important to the people of Italy than the Prime Minister?

The people who make the laws and rules are making them for every Italian citizen. If they say that the rollout has to proceed from healthcare workers to vulnerable people to old people and then essential workers and everyone else in the end, that's how it goes. The protection of important politicians and public figures has been achieved by the safety and precautionary measures allowed by the things they control, like their collaborators, salaries, and the offices/living spaces that the State gives them, but for the vaccines the rules are the same for everyone because the national and regional governments decide.",pics
"I'm sure I'm wrong, but enough with the soon-to-be-dead people and let us who actually have 40 years plus left have a shot","You could easily die today. Or tomorrow. Do older people not deserve as much of a chance to live and survive a virus as you do? Maybe ask yourself why you're making this about you and not being supportive of any aged person making an important decision for their health, esp if they are at a higher risk of severe disease and death.",pics
"It is insane to me that the sentence ""like other 79 year old citizens"" is normal.  Why are we letting people over the age of 65 run countries.  And I am including the U.S. in that equation too.  These people are not in touch with the modern problems facing our countries, societies, and the globe today.","He’s just the president, his role in Italy has relative power",pics
"And they became the first European country to get past 100,000 deaths.",Maybe the up side of Brexit is that the UK isn’t counted in European statistics now :-/,pics
So the US isn’t the only country electing fossils to the presidency,"he was president of Constitutional Court and teacher Constitutional Law, never seen a better fossil in the right place",pics
Am I jaded to think he definitely got it already and just got it again for optics?,"No, you are an idiot",pics
"That's fucking stupid if that's the case, he's an elected official, he was elected by his people for a reason and the same why they need physical protection, he needs the vaccine due to a potential threat to him to keep him alive.  This is irresponsible of any leader and government to do this to think ""He's one of the people"". That's not how it works. 

I know people want to bitch about who's getting it first and who isn't.  Get the people at least who make the decisions we put them in charge of taken care of.  I get that sometimes they don't represent you well...that's for you to voice though and also vote for next time.","Damned if you do, damned if you don't.",pics

"Wait, doesn’t Italy use a king?","They haven't since 1946. The previous king worked to closely with Musolini so he was removed and his son took his place. after that, italy was sick of being a monarchy and held a vote to become a republic.",pics
79 - Jesus we are already on 50 year olds,"But at least they’re doing teachers and students too, rather than sending them back to school with no vaccine",pics
"Good PR move, but an objectively dumb decision.

The health of the head of state is inarguably more important than that of regular citizens, simply for the fact that it helps run the damn place.",He has no power on day to day operation and he doesn’t need a pr move because he is elected by the parliament and won’t run for reelection,pics
is that the same dude who had bunga bunga parties?,"Actually, It's the same dude who saw his brother murdered by the mafia and lost his wife to cancer.",pics
"Had no shortcuts, but got the vaccine before millions of people, interesting.","Got it when it was his demographics turn, like how I’ve had mine and millions haven’t",pics
"Meanwhile the 2/3 of the vaccine doses expire on the fridges in Italy. BUT HEY, he waited in line!",No they don't,pics
"Ah, so that's why they repossessed the vaccines heading for Australia","Repossessed vaccines were relocated in the EU as a whole, also they were the AstraZeneca vaccines, while he got the Moderna one",pics

There’s no way he didn’t get it early. He probably got it privately and now this is fake. All a show. There’s no reason someone that powerful and influential would risk their life and wait. There is no benefit when you can get a fake shot and then have media take pictures of you. Leaders should get priority.

"This was agreed upon in the EU I think, so it's for all those countries.

It's completely stupid. If there's someone you shouldn't risk getting the virus is the people running the country. But people are cunts and the political opposition have been cunts too as usual so this gets around that problem.","But the president isn't the one running it, it's those bureaucrats sitting in offices that actually implement stuff.",pics
He’s an idiot trust me,"He started his political career shortly after his brother, a politician too, was assassinated for fighting a big criminal organization. He then worked to ensure such organization was left out of politics, risking his life too. Has worked as a university professor, has been appointed to 3 different ministries, has served as vice-president of the Ministries' Counsil, has been appointed judge of the Constitutional Court, and finally was chosen for the highest role of his nation (not the most influential, but the most respected).

It's great. How did you do that? Please explain.,"Removing spots, rips, stains, etc:

Use the stamp tool to select an area that looks similar to the spot but without the damage and apply the new area to culprit.

Alignment:

Rotate and use Distort to straighten out edges.

Overall quality:

Use Exposure, Highlights & Shadows, Curves, Brightness & Contrast to the point where the highlights are sharp, the darks are vivid but there's still detail left in-between. Use Smart-Sharpen to clear up any blurry sections in the photo.

Coloring:

Two ways to do it. The destructive way (Fast but you can't change it in the future) would be to simply trace out the sections you want in a certain color and apply a color filter to it with the color you want. Rinse and repeat until you get to this.

Or you can go the nondestructive path (Slow but you can keep improving it) and once again trace the areas, but now, create separate layers and fill in the spots with a color that corresponds to it (trees = green, etc) and use the transparency slider to play around with it.

Misc:

Use Color-Range to pin-point small and spread out sections that need to be the same color.

Use Color-Replace to make fine adjustments within a layer to certain accent colors.

Use Burn to darken sections of the photo that came out too bright but you know should be darker.

I could go on but those will get you pretty far.",pics

"22 year old Elizabeth L. Remba Gardner, of Rockford, Illinois, Class 43-W-6 WASP (Women Airforce Service Pilot) at the controls of a Martin B-26 'Marauder' medium bomber. Harlingen Army Air Field, Texas, 1943.


About her Experiences—

""My name is Elizabeth L. Gardner, or for short, Libby Gardner. I am a pilot for the Women Aircraft Service Planes. a.k.a. WASP, which is considered a civil service. Before the war, I was a housewife and a mother who stayed home to take care of my family. I was called to duty when the war started to learn how to test planes, instruct pilots, tow targets used for anti-aircraft artillery practice, and assemble planes. I was grateful for the opportunity because it made my childhood dreams of flying and fascinations with planes a reality. I work 7 days out of the week and some of those days happen to be better than others. When I first started learning, I was eager and nervous and also had two days of training under Lieutenant Col. Paul Tibbets who later commanded the B-29 that dropped the first atom bomb on Hiroshima. The training consisted of three phases; primary, basic, and advanced. On the days that we have check rides, a lot of pressure can be put on us women, and we feel that we must make a name for ourselves in this industry. I had a check ride the other day, and I must say that things did not go so well for me that day. The man testing me was very quiet and sarcastic and did not give me much information or say a lot to let me know how I was doing. I would make mistakes as turning to far out or using too much rudder on the turns; I did my best to relax, but his sarcastic remarks did not make it easy and different items in my performance were still sloppy including my stalls. The only good thing that came from that test was my landing; it was possible that he would give me credit for that, but instead he stepped out of the airplane without saying a word about whether or not I passed. I held back my tears. The opportunity is wonderful, and I love doing this every day.”",Ohh...I thought you were calling her a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant,pics

Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 Vaccination""",pics
"Good on you for not jumping the line while also ensuring extra doses don’t go bad. 

Mildly related. Veterans enrolled in the VA Hospital system can call their local VA hospital. Multiple states including NY, MI, OK, and WA are offering vaccinations for us.","That's great news!

 I think that means my brother might qualify. Is it any vet or the vets that meet the current requirements?",pics
Getting your vaccine in a supermarket is the most American thing.,"I know right. My sister works with a population that she needed to get the vaccine at the beginning of Feb. I took her to her appointment and it was this long car caravan operation...

Both experiences were not what I would typically expect of a vaccine situation.",pics
Congrats.  May i ask how you qualified and how long did it take to get an appointment?,"I don't qualify. Last week I called a bunch of local pharmacies let them know I didn't qualify, but asked if I could get on a list in case someone misses their appointment, or they opened a vial and needed to give it to someone before it goes bad....

Most pharmacies didn't have a list I could get on. The ones that did have a list still prioritized by age and other things. I put my dad on the same list as I and they called him first, but the day after I put us both on the list his age group was able to get the vaccine and he already had an appointment for today.

A bit later the pharmacy called me and I had to race to get there.",pics
How can this be surreal,"It just doesn't feel all the way real. I've been living in covid lockdown, I only see my sister's fam and we're masked the whole time, I'm young with no underlying conditions. I felt like I wasn't going to get my vaccine for a long time. Plus there is the relief of not getting or giving covid to people I love who might get really sick from it. Then you add that it wasn't a planned shot, I had to rush to go get it. It's not like the idea had time to sink in. Even today it's a little surreal.",pics
Nice!,I know!! It's such a relief!!,pics
"""Surreal""?","It feels unreal, unbelievable, or live a dream",pics
[removed],"Yes, you never know. In my state a boy under 15 died today. What's more is that my daughter has asthma and a cold can put her in the hospital, what would covid do.

However my 13-year-old brother and I climbed this on my 15th birthday, and my dear brother got impatient with the traffic between the cables. So he scrambled the rock outside the cables in order to climb faster.

"On the surface it appears that you are in the right place but there's still a lot of problematic things going on here.

Young girls don't start out liking ""pink"" and ""dresses"". It's suspicious that she would have picked out, coincidentally, a pink car on her own. At a young age you could have been talking to her about how she doesn't have to like pink because ""she's a girl"". 

Same thing with the dress, why encourage that she conform to gender stereotypes at such a young age?

Are you sure that this is her choice and not the box you're putting her in? Don't underestimate your biases and influence and toxic traits, they can't be covered up with a couple of bumper stickers.

Why does the ""big man"" need the big gun? Had to give her the ""small girly gun""?

Being progressive and forward thinking is about positivity. I recognize that you may be in a conflicted phase of your life right now, the image is a juxtaposed combination of toxic masculinity with sprinkles of evidence that you may want to better yourself and change.

Pay it forward for your daughters, what type of work do you do? Show them that you understand you didn't earn that work and offer your employer to help locate and train a diverse replacement hire.

Show your daughters you're more than a bumper sticker.","Based solely on this single comment, and your username (which raises most of the flags in China), you seem like a person looking for problems to ""advise"" upon.
  
Lots of fucking presumptions in your commentary. Perhaps the other young girls she associates with, and/or her female relatives, influence her to liking pink (and in this case, I will say, ROCK IT). Or maybe, you know, she does just simply like it.  
  
Are you so obtuse that the scaling of the awesome Dinosaur nerf guns fits rather well with the body sizes of both of them? The big gun may be unwieldy for her significantly smaller arms and hands.  
  

I won't even go into your outright political and workforce nonsense. Who the fuck are you to accusatorily state that he ""didn't earn that work?"" No-fucking-body when you have preface with ""what type of work do you do.""

This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

> According to Sarah Hervé, the interpretive ranger for Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona, said the specimen in the photo is not opalized at all.

> Instead, it's closer to agate, which is a form of quartz.

> Both opal and agate are silica-based minerals, but agates have a crystalline structure, while opals do not.

Does the texture hold paint well? That looks cool.,"It is going to cause the paint to seep down into the groves and when mixing colors, it won't truely mix as you will still have base paint in the grooves below.

Clean up is going to be a disaster. you can't just wipe the paint off your pallet. Gonna have to wash it off. If you are using a oil base, you will need mineral spirits to wash it, and then the mineral spirits will eat through the vinal.

Someone want to ELI5 why this woman is dead and Brittany Spears' daddy controls her life after a buzzcut? Anybody?,">Someone want to ELI5 why this woman is dead and Brittany Spears' daddy controls her life after a buzzcut? Anybody?

The people around Amy let her, or did nothing against her, increasingly worse, drug addiction. Some of them, allegedly, helped her continue down the path of self-destruction. They were more concerned about profiting off of her work than taking care of her as a human being.

Britney Spears' father was able to seize control of her assets and earnings after she had a very public breakdown when going through the toughest period in her life and he has been unrelenting about giving any of that control back. Britney Spears has asked courts to give her more control over her earnings multiple times but has seen very little success in her appeals because the law  that allowed him to take control over his daughter's earnings is very hard to disprove in a court of law.

A few years ago she walked away from a very lucrative contract to perform at Las Vegas as a regular and stated she wouldn't perform again until her father gave her control over her earnings again. Her father maintain his position to this day.

In my opinion, I think it's unlikely Britney will ever have control over her life or money unless her father blows through all of her money and needs more or whichever judge next looks at her case makes the reasonable choice.

TLDR; on Britney - her father manipulated and controlled most of her life and took advantage of his daughter during the hardest period in her life instead of helping her out. He enjoys having access to her vast wealth and maintains that as long as she's pampered enough she shouldn't really be complaining about it.",pics

edit; I don't really mind the downvotes, but for the record I was just expressing that I'm glad it was reposted, I really enjoyed the photo and the discussion around it, and no amount of downvotes here or elsewhere can change that :)  if it hadn't been reposted I wouldn't have seen it.",pics
He looks so nice ! :),This guy is really nice! We went to the same college and he had the same science advisor as me.

So his first dog was a rescue. His neighbor saw a stray and thought it was his dog, so the neighbor brings the stray to him and he decides to adopt it as well.

Fast forward a few years and he's getting his official photo taken on base. He gets a big van and has a friend sit in the back hiding with the dogs to keep them calmed down and smuggles them on base. Once over where the photographer is, he brings them out for a few of the photos.","That's badass lol.

In fact, it’s fair to consider that this could push greater innovation in renewable energy to keep such operations profitable and running.",pics
"Here is where OP took the pic from.  The article has more information.

[https://news.bitcoin.com/natural-gas-bitcoin-mining-operation/](https://news.bitcoin.com/natural-gas-bitcoin-mining-operation/)","Brilliant share! This bitcoin mine was literally a coal mine that was repurposed to be natural gas facility.

“Atlas’s partnership with Greenidge represents a $65 million investment into the facility and it wasn’t just the installation of 7,000 machines; funds were spent on the power plant’s conversion costs and infrastructure changes as well. When the plant was a coal mine, Atlas used considerable efforts to convert the site into a natural gas and biomass facility and now the operation solely uses natural gas.”",pics
Would love to know how some of these tanks endd up here. Sure seeing a Sherman on a beach kinda makes sense given how many were around in the Pacific during WW2，but who the hell leaves Chieftins lying around in the middle of a forest，Walker Bulldogs in the middle of (stunningly beautiful) fields，or M2A2s on a bloody mountain?,"Like everything else in life it boils down to simple economic decisions. Does it have more value than the cost to recover it? Is the risk of leaving it there going to cost us more in the long run verses cleaning it up? In most cases the answer is no and so nobody bothers. It will sit there until the scrap metal value, value of the land it sits on, or the danger to humans/environment is high enough to justify removing it. Europe is still cleaning up from WW1 and WW2, a jungle in the middle of nowhere will take WAY longer.",pics

"I've been here! (USA guy here, pardon my excitement)

My extended family lives in one of these houses. We jumped from the deck into the sea on a ""summer"" morning instead of taking a shower and by pure coincidence missed an entire swarm of jellyfish only moments later. We also hiked to the top of that domey rock in the back of the photo. Stunning! On a clear day, supposedly Scotland (Shetland Islands) is visible. Norwegians always have afternoon coffee and dessert, so my (distant) cousin hiked all the way to the top with a big thermos of coffee and a box of sweet biscuits, much to our joyous surprise. 

My parents backpacked here in the 80s for their honeymoon. This road didn't exist - there are an absurd number of bridges mostly built in only the last 20 years - and no mobile phones. So the story goes they just turned up one day and waited for a few hours until a little motorboat came by to pluck them from the mainland. Fascinating to think about. 

If you can ever visit, my relatives operate a small guesthouse: http://www.bulandet-grendalag.org/grepstadOvernatt.htm

Downside: Norway is gut-punch expensive.

But some truly magnificent landscapes and a functional civility that is both modern in all the necessary ways, yet traditional and truly bound by community in so many others.

How we get water; many households, especially older ones, have their own rain water wells. All newer households (and most older ones too) are hooked up to a local water supply - a small dam, I suppose you can call it. From there it goes in ...pipes are a bit generous.. tubes I guess, to the various areas (and parts of this system is under sea water). There have been times of drought where we've been supplied fresh water by ship. 

For sewage - most households have septic tanks dug down near the buildings, which get collected from at regular intervals. A few of the older households still have sewage going directly to sea.",pics

Half of the Netherlands will be below see level before a single road there is underwater.,pics
"Would this be considered a wealthy neighborhood, house, with docks and a private road maybe?  Curious.","Not particularly, no. Roads are municipal. I bet most people living there are making pretty average salaries, maybe a bit above average. It's pretty remote, so the well-paying jobs aren't in great supply.

It's all on an island. The landscape far in the back is not even the mainland. That's another pair of islands and the mainland is behind that again.",pics
"This looks very, very expensive to buy and maintain.","Maintain? Nah. Granted, there is salt spray,  and more wind than average. So the wooden houses need painting a bit more often than an inland or highland building, but those have their own location-specific issues. The replacement rate of panelling, windows and roof tiles may be slightly higher than an average prairie suburb, but not crazily so. Source: Family home one meter from the sea is pushing 300 and still has some mid-19th century windows left.

Buy? Depends. If you want a house like this as a holiday home, it can be expensive. However, some homes in places like this come with a clause committing the owner to actually living there, which at least helps keep the prices down. Another big help is that many Norwegian villages are hemorrhaging young people to the urban centers; if you can find a job in a rural area, many places have homes left empty, and relatively low prices.",pics

obviously some solid life choices to lead people living there.. wonder what’s a stating price on the cheapest place there.,Depends on how close it is to a big city. You could probably get a house on a place like this for €100k if you are ok with being 3h from a larger city.,pics
"As a civil engineer, this just seems like a ton of infrastructure (roads/bridges) for a small amount of access. Who pays for the roads?",these are certainly public roads,pics
Do you reckon more people here would have boats than cars?,"That used to be the case (and still I think there might technically be more boats than cars, but just about everyone owns a car).
The bridges you see in the background are fairly new, less than 20 years old. When I was a kid, you had to take the ferry for 2.5 hours to get to the mainland, so many didn't bother with getting a car, or got a rental instead if they needed.",pics

"First fireworks picture, trees and stars all look really good. Shots are dynamic and engaging. There is balance in the high contrast and you can tell the composition was thought out. The fireworks look so close to dandelions I had to look closely. Really nice. 

I think the second fireworks picture and the angel statue picture have too many conflicts. Second fireworks shot is washed out because of the clouds.

""In the mid-80s, HIV/Aids terrified the world because of a lack of understanding as well as misinformation.

In April 1987, Princess Diana opened the UK's first purpose built HIV/Aids unit that exclusively cared for patients infected with the virus, at London Middlesex Hospital.

In front of the world's media, Princess Diana shook the hand of a man suffering with the illness.

She did so without gloves, publicly challenging the notion that HIV/Aids was passed from person to person by touch.

She showed in a single gesture that this was a condition needing compassion and understanding, not fear and ignorance.

John O'Reilly was a nurse on the ward at the time of the Princess of Wales' visit.

He spoke to Witness about a landmark moment in the fight against HIV/Aids.""","And in the Thirty years since then, we have made impressive progress, up to the point where we safely can say that an undetectable viral load equals it being untransmittable in any form. (undetectable = untransmittable)

By all accounts she was a lovely person.,"There's a great doc on Netflix called Diana: In Her Own Words.

She so badly just wanted to be loved and when her own family couldn't love her, the people did.",pics
"As an actor in Hollywood in the early 1980s I found myself at the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic when it first struck.  In 1980 I was directing a play and one of my actors, a deeply closeted gay man, kept missing rehearsals because he kept getting sick.  He told me he had ""picked up some kind of weird virus that the doctors can't identify"".  He had to drop out of the show and three months later he died, only the third diagnosed victim in Los Angeles county of the newly identified AIDS virus.

The epidemic struck with the force of a storm and a diagnosis was a death notice.   Doctors quickly realized that the highest risk people were IV users who shared needles and gay people.  Beyond that we didn't know how easily the virus could be contracted.  Even though I wasn't in either of the high-risk groups I was still afraid.  It wasn't known if it could be spread by contact as casual as shaking hands or drinking from the same water fountain.  At first, it was unknown if it could even be airborne and just being in the same room as an infected person could be dangerous.  We just didn't know.

While producing at a repertory theatre company we worked with the Hollywood Gay and Lesbian Alliance to do a number of fund-raising performances benefitting the Alliance.  As a producer I worked on each event with the Alliance's volunteer chairman to organize the events.  In a two year period four of those men died of AIDS.  Two more actors in my company, dear friends both, also died.

Between 1980 and 1984 I lost 14 friends, co-workers and neighbors to AIDS.  After that I just lost count.  The fear in those early days was palpable.  If you weren't there you can't really understand.","Channel 4 recently made a brilliant miniseries about the AIDS epidemic in the 80s called It’s A Sin.  It’s written by Russell T Davies (Queer as Folk, Dr Who) from his experiences of being a young gay man in the 80s.  It’s one of the most moving TV shows I’ve ever seen and I can definitely recommend it, if the subject matter isn’t too painful for you.  They do a really good job of conveying things like the fear you described.",pics

"HIV doesn't spread the same way as COVID does. HIV spreads itself via blood or sexual intercourse, so a handshake is completely safe. One cannot get HIV/AIDS by droplets. But it's more or less likely to get COVID this way. If that person had COVID, masks and gloves would be necessary for both Diana and the infected one.  HIV and COVID are completely different things.","Well then it's a good thing that this photo was taken in the 1980s when people legitimately did think that HIV can spread through casual contact.

The point of this photo was to dispel that belief.",pics

In many cases I found movies that turned out to be great that I might turn off now, simply because it was the movie I had to stick with.

Then I finally decide, but alas it’s NOW an exclusive for a streaming service I don’t have. So then I sit down to negotiate with myself and decide if it’s worth buying.

"The Sinaloa dudes tunneling in literal tons of drugs into the united states along with human trafficking are definitely illegal. Folks here without green cards are also illegal... I love the premise of this but it's a bit of a stretch when used in the ""legal"" context.","No human is illegal. 

The ""illegals"" moniker was a recentish GOP change to what was previously described as ""Undocumented Immigrants"". By calling a person illegal you frame them in a way that allows one to not have to think of them as a person. It makes it easier to treat them poorly. To enslave them, to torture them. To steal their children. 

American citizens smuggle people and drugs. They still enslave children and sexually assault them. But those people are not ""illegal"" and they are treated well if they have the right connections.

Heck, going 31 in a 30 is illegal. But no one calls us ""illegals"" for doing that.",pics

I assume you used photoshop? Looks like you just copied the colors from a picture while alternating brush size and softness.,I’m a digital artist as a profession and to me it looks like they used a blurring filter over the original photo then used the paint and blend tools over it a little. Some areas have distinct strokes and others look like a photo that had been blurred like in the eyes and around the teeth. There also seemed to be a necklace around the models neck that got distorted in the process. They went from really expressive strokes to these low contrast muddy ones which would be fine but there doesn’t seem to be any consistency in their style.,pics

"Yo just wanted to say this is great. 

Reading a lot of comments debating whether digital painting is equivalent to traditional is maddening. It’s like listening to couch potatoes debate about whether martial arts or ballet takes more skill—y’all never get off the couch you have no idea what you’re talking about. 

As someone who prefers oil painting, but sometimes digital paints, I can say they’re just different. Each has unique challenges. I find oil painting easier actually, though there’s something to be said for layers and “undo” buttons in digital. 

Regardless, digital painting takes the exact same skills. Both require careful brush strokes and direction, shading, mixing—BITB require the same principles used to convey perspective and dimension on a flat plane. 

Basically, I think people only diminish a skill set when they either have no concept of its requirements, or are insecure in their own skills so they have to jerk themselves about how much more difficult it is. Ignore the fuckers. 

Artists shouldn’t diminish other forms. Non artists should go back to watching tv with a hand down their pants and save their uninformed breath. 

Keep up the great work. Your art is cool af, ignore the mouth breathers.",*both,pics
