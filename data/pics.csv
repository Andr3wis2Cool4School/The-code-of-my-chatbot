"Snuffles is his slave name, he's called Snowball cos his fur is pretty and white","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",pics

I live in this city, there is definitely poverty and misery in there. But we don't have large ""favelas"" like some here seems to think.

I regularly see people searching in trashcans in my street.

Big cities are like that. They often underline the wealth gap between people. I think the most impressive contrast I have seen like that was in ... Miami. Homeless people, limos, clubs for the super rich. This was pretty weird. Still this was a small part of Miami and certainly not what represents Miami.",pics
Less sketchy looking than all the encampments here in Austin,"Homeless encampments I‚Äôve seen in North America are very transient in nature.

These look more permanent, like the people intend to live in them a long time, and they know how to put them together. The authorities aren‚Äôt going to come along and kick them out. They are investing in the homes.

The North American homeless population is mostly people suffering from mental health problems and/or addiction. This population seems to be simply poor, but far more capable and invested in their homes. Both are sad. Both seem like societal failings, but I think they serve slightly different populations.",pics

I had a homeless co-worker in Vegas who would show up late sometimes because the police would scoop him up and drop him off on the other side of town to a homeless shelter. Even though he told them he was walking to work! If he didn't go he would be arrested.

"I agree that at the elementary and secondary levels there shouldn't be an overbearing amount of homework, but there should be an abundance of preparation.  Individual mastery of any subject weather it be critical thinking (math) or memorization (history and English) requires a certain amount of personal practice.  The concept of homework should be focused on this preparation and practice in order to demonstrate true understanding and mastery of a subject.  I don't think that you can TOTALLY eliminate homework, but the concept as to why and what is assigned should be carefully designed to add value to the student's progress in the course.","You're pretty close. The research is very clear that there are two different types of homework. The first kind would be repeating or reinforcing what has already been learned. This is most commonly done with things like worksheets and spelling lists. This type of homework has been shown again and again to be either completely worthless or a very little value. Certainly not worth the time.

The second kind of homework is preparatory. This involves kids interfacing with texts or videos or gathering information or materials that they're going to then use later in the classroom. This might be something like asking a kid to interview their grandparent about what the '70s was like for them and then bring that interview to class to do something with it. Or, it might be something like watching a video about Mars and creating some questions or making a poster about it. The key is that they will then bring those questions or post your two class and do something with them.

That second type, often known as inductive presentation, has been shown to be very helpful for kids learning.",pics
"Counterpoint to this for students at a certain age and maturity level:

Sometimes you DO need to do things yourself, and entirely yourself. There is a teaching experience associated with completing a large project that simply cannot be replicated in an invigilated group.

So I love the message this teacher is sending. But it shouldn't apply to, I'll say, college or university level students in their third or fourth year, where that student is focusing on a career path where their work will often depend on them imposing a structure themselves. They're too close to the point in life where they may have to work in a non-supportive environment and with their own accountability. It should be changed up at that point.

"Per [here](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/second-grade-teachers-unique-homework-policy-goes-viral/), which also has a video interview with this teacher (i.e Brandy Young).

> **Second-grade teacher's unique homework policy goes viral**

> BY JENNIFER EARL

> UPDATED ON: AUGUST 24, 2016 / 9:20 AM / CBS NEWS

> Every school year, elementary school students are faced with new challenges.

> They have to make new friends, get to know new teachers and learn how to juggle more complex courses.

> But there‚Äôs at least one stressful thing second-graders at Godley Elementary School in Texas won‚Äôt have to worry about this year: homework.

> Brandy Young, a second-grade teacher at the school, passed out a letter to every parent at a ‚ÄúMeet the Teacher Night‚Äù ahead of the start of the school year to explain her new homework policy -- or should we say, no-homework policy

> A pleased parent posted a photo of the letter on her Facebook page, and it went viral with more than 59,000 shares.

> ‚ÄúBrooke is loving her new teacher already!‚Äù Samantha Gallagher captioned the picture.

> The mother of 7-year-old Brooke was thrilled to know that her daughter won‚Äôt be overwhelmed with homework this year...

> The teacher said homework just wasn‚Äôt working for her classroom anymore. So, she decided to make meaningful change.

> ‚Äú[Students] work hard all day. When they go home they have other things they need to learn there,‚Äù Young told CBS News. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to develop their whole person; it‚Äôs not beneficial to go home and do pencil and paper work.

> Dozens of people praised Young‚Äôs view on homework, Gallagher included.

> ‚ÄúFinally more teachers are catching on to this!‚Äù one Facebook user commented.

> ‚ÄúHopefully this will change some things,‚Äù another wrote.

> Gallagher is looking forward to the new routine.

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre happy that at the end of a long school day she‚Äôll get to come home and unwind and be a kid... go outside to play, make new friends, spend more time as a family,‚Äù Gallagher said.

> Young, who is a parent herself, wants to bring more families together.

> The Godley Independent School District is a district of innovation, following The Leader in Me school model, Young explained.

> ‚ÄúOur superintendent really encouraged us to be innovators,‚Äù Young said. ‚ÄúWhether or not it‚Äôs popular, I just wanted to see if it would work. You can‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs gonna work unless you try it.‚Äù

> Several other teachers within the district are also considering taking a similar ‚Äúno homework‚Äù approach. And Young is happy to hear it. 

> ‚ÄúFor any teacher considering anything that might benefit their students I say go for it; if something doesn‚Äôt work, change it,‚Äù she said.","It's second grade, who gets lots of homework in second grade anyways?",pics
"Would love to see that research.

Intuitively and anecdotally, homework helps by repetition at the very least. Of course, it wouldn't if you don't do it. Or if you cheat, or do it in a really half-assed way.","There‚Äôs heaps out there, and likely specific to whatever country/culture you‚Äôre in. 
What you‚Äôre talking about is basic, repeatable skill kind of work which shouldn‚Äôt be a large part of learning anyway.",pics
"Do countries held to be the best systems in the world also have a no homework policy? Seems a pretty strong counter to this statement. For example, Japan and South Korea have homework. Finland doesn‚Äôt have homework but it‚Äôs hard to say they‚Äôve been an important contributor to global policy.","Japan and South Korea have really different social constructs when it comes to schooling and work ethic (compared to Western cultures like America, UK, etc). Homework should work because more learning is good but it would have a different level of effectiveness depending on how it's acted upon.

Broad generalizations here but, I'd say a student in Japan is more likely to see homework as additional learning taken seriously as a chance to study and improve, whereas a student in the UK views it as something to be done as quickly as possible (if at all) before they can move on to other things.",pics
"I have seen this idea first hand with my nephew and nieces. One is in a district that does not do homework and the others get homework sheets. Same grade, my brothers raised their kids similarly, the difference in their ability is huge. Especially in math and spelling (basically all they‚Äôre doing at that age). Poor guy has a really hard time with multiplication tables, while the others blow through them. I really believe that practice with homework sheets is needed.","Don't confuse a natural ability with homework.

Difference between correlation and causation.

Algebra is very difficult for some and hard for others. Math is a language, and if you don't grasp the foundations of math, you are forever lost.

No matter how much you push into a person, some things they will be worse at then others.


Teachers matter. Periodt. Some teachers merely pass students along while others educate. Again, correlation is not causation. 

Last, it depends on the student.

There is no correlation nor causation between failing and homework. Or not doing as well in certain subjects over others.",pics
"This is bogus. No research? There's decades upon decades or research on memory recollection and how repetition drives memories from short term into long term. Memory is like chiseling a stone. The more times you drive the chisel into the stone, the bigger the dent in the stone, the better you will remember said material. Whether it's reading similar material in a book that the teacher talked about or doing similar math problems 30 times in a row. 

&#x200B;

If you want to destroy American public education even further, then adopt this ""no homework"" policy. All these people who claim ""it never helped me at all!"" simply don't know what they're talking about and don't recognize it did help them in school. 

If I spend **an hour** telling you how to take apart a car and put it back together, give you no homework, and then give you a test on it a week later, how well do you think you'd do? 99% would fail because there is no learning that can take place in one, one-hour session about a topic. You need hours of repetitive learning over days and weeks to retain detailed information. It's all about repetition and ""no homework"" destroys this.","I agree with you on the repetition part, however the time to do this should not be in the hours after school. The schedule should have time slotted to do the work.",pics
"So if you do nothing in school, you have homework to do. But they say that homework isn't productive?","They didn't say homework isn't productive. No, they said assigning ""homework"" for the sake of homework isn't proven to do anything additional to the classwork. If you skip the classwork or fall behind you get to take it home and make up the work so that the classwork can keep going on pace.",pics
"I never understood homework. I have always believed, whether I was in elementary school or college, that an instructor who can‚Äôt manage to fully teach a subject during class is not worth a shit and should be fired. And the teacher is right, family time is far more important than another needless assignment. Writing assignments with due dates a week away and tests on the covered content seem fine to me. Allow the student to study the subject on their own, but don‚Äôt require it.","It puts way too much responsibility on the kid to structure their own time. You think a kid who doesn't want to do homework is going to voluntarily plan out independent review of what they learned each day? If they do, guess what, they created their own homework assignments.",pics
"The most educated man I know is an unusually-highly-educated teacher.  Multiple PhD's, lots and lots of degrees (including several in education), been teaching around the world for decades, highly sought-after and paid serious money by top schools to teach even way into retirement.  He now usually gets paid enough to move to a country, teach only for a year, live off that money in that country for several years, get married, get divorced, move country again and then get another teaching job (which is usually a case of just going through his inbox and choosing from the hundreds of offers that get sent to him ALL THE TIME from everywhere from Singapore to Kuwait, the US to Europe).

One private school that hired him saw such a HUGE increase in his students in just a year that they literally accused him of cheating the tests - so he asked the entire year group to re-sit their exams, just for him (and his students love him, so they all said yes, and their parents all could see the change in their kids, so they all supported him), the resit paper was set by an entirely independent teacher, it was monitored and invigilated like a full examination, and the students all got... exactly the same high results.  (He then resigned in protest at being insulted, but that's besides the point).

He does not set homework. It's a nonsense. Always has been.

And I'm very fortunate that he's my ex-father-in-law and is currently home-schooling my daughter (who has gone from average state primary school to a private school abroad in a matter of just a few years of living with him - and the school fees were paid for because it was one of the conditions of his taking the job, so they were paying him a top wage far more than all his peers, relocation allowance and visa to a foreign country for him and his immediate family, a fully-funded school place for my daughter and then gave him whatever he needed to fund his teaching).

Homework is not teaching.  Teaching is not homework.  Teaching without a qualified professional in the room to analyse, gauge, and pitch their lesson in the right manner is a nonsense (by-rote teaching is therefore a nonsense).

And I say this as someone who worked in dozens of schools for my entire career, not as a teacher, and is the mortal sworn enemy of all teachers I meet.

Homework is a nonsense.  If you want to set homework, make schools 9-5 instead.","My husband is an educator and he agrees with this, especially with little kids. The only situation where he can agree with homework is if the child is struggling in a topic, then it's up for the parent/ guardian to assist with homework and work with their teacher(s) to help get up to speed.",pics
"This would work for my four year old who is currently in his first year of school. Granted, he is doing his homework by himself, saying sounds and coming up with words that start with that letter and trying to recognise sight words. All I do is read to him daily. He loves books. I don't think it's necessary for four year olds to have homework. He is so exhausted from school.","Wow, that is crazy. Sad for your kids that they are requiring that.

"I call the years of irreparable damage caused by homework ""The Homework Wars"".

Night after night of fighting and being punished over and over and over for nothing.  I didn't get bad grades because I was stupid or didn't understand the material, I just didn't want to spend my evenings, the little free time I had to be a kid, doing bullshit work.  But my parents correlated my value as a person to my ability to complete homework assignments.  It was awful.  It's great when you're a child and you just want to be a kid on those beautiful summer and winter evenings, but you are constantly reminded what a disappointment you are because of it.  Yet you watch your classmates get straight A's not because they are the smartest, but because they complete the work.  

Fuck homework.","This sounds like a very long way of saying you were lazy and resented those who put effort into self improvement. Effort *should* trump natural ability. I find it weird that you're trying to spin it like they were less deserving of As than you.

You got bad grades because you were lazy. You clashed with your parents because they put value in self discipline and work ethic and you were too lazy to do those things. 

Guess what? Nobody likes working. Everyone wants to spend their carefree evenings doing bugger all. However, people sacrifice their time to achieve self improvement and guess what? Others value that because it is a productive and positive trait.",pics
"It's important to note that schools will have a fixed curriculum of topics and targets for learners to go through and if on higher edy then that can be mandatory in evidence based work.
For children it is important to give them skills and learning that will hopefully inspire them in their lives and develop interests in learning and what they like.

While yes any work going home not done in school would still be home work, I think it's more based at having just the curriculum and not additional work set just so that homework is set.
That study would fall apart if learners did not do the work in school because that would be the only school directed learning they are getting.

I teach post 14/16 and I set homework, but I set activities rather than worksheets and ones that match the subject such as identifying what plumbing systems a person has in their home, what type of boiler, even what type of heating system layout, etc ( I teach plumbing ).

Homework can be beneficial if it's actually useful, unortunately too many teachers set it for the sake of it and don't consider how it can improve learning because they're just meeting a school policy of target.","Also, the study published on homework outlined that high school students, and only 1 maybe 1.5 hours assignments and no more.

Here's the actual point: Homework has not been proven as correlation to success WHEN IT'S OVER AND ABOVE A MINIMAL LEVEL OF IN-CLASS WORK. 

OTOH, not doing the work at all has absolutely been proven as correlation to not being successful. 

This treads middle ground. You have to do a minimal amount of work to be successful. (Yes, exceptions like buying your way through life because your parents are billionaires apply.) So if you don't do that minimal amount of work in the class, you have to do it out of class.",pics

"This teacher is dead wrong though.

Know why countries like Japan run circles around Western countries in math and science performance? Because it's drill, baby, drill. 

At that age, if you're not constantly working at it, the knowledge won't stick. Students need the structure, repetition and reinforcement.

Not to say, of course, that holistic learning doesn't have its place (or that Japan does a good job in fostering critical thinking compared to the West) but it has to be grounded in that more structured approach.","> why countries like Japan run circles around Western countries in math and science performance?

Was the 90's Vietnam's disco era?,"I think so, but 90s is probably the end of it. I'm not sure what's classified as disco exactly but I remember when I was 3 or 4, which was 1991-1992, my older brother (19-20) took a picture with a bunch of his friends, most of them wore bellbottom pants. It went out of style just a couple of years later I think.

It started much later than the US probably because Vietnam was sanctioned and isolated. There was hardly any influence from Western culture. It was my brother generation who started to listen to music like ABBA, Beatles, Elvis, etc.",pics

I kinda like the idea of the decoy.  Means the police are interested in slowing down speeders rather than collecting fines.  The double ruse copception gambit is hilarious though.,It's probably because people learn of the decoy and think it's just a decoy,pics
When the sun hurts your eyes through the only untitnted window,Heh you said tit.,pics
What is happening in this picture,A cop is hiding behind a decoy police car.  The decoy is used to scare drivers into slowing down but drivers get used to the decoy and ignore it.  Hence a real cop is hiding behind the decoy to catch the driver who ignore the decoy.  Sneaky bastard,pics
What's the point?,"Probably put the cutout there for a while giving drivers time to realize that it is a decoy and to ignore it. Now the actual cop is hiding behind it,presumably with a radar gun, waiting for driver to be complacent and ignore the decoy so that he can pull them over and meet his quota.",pics
The old double bluff.,Little do the drivers know there's just a mannequin in there. Triple bluff.,pics
What is the logo on the facade for?,"Its to fool drivers  into thinking there's a real cop there.  This would make the driver slow down.  The thing is common in eastern Europe.  Having said that,  drivers get used to the decoys and speed anyway....but here the cop is a sneaky bastard


Edit.   Lol I misread your question.  I thought you wrote logic lol",pics
"Anyone else think it's wrong that cops lie in wait for anyone who may be operating just outside the rules of the road so that they can ticket them?  It feels like a public fleecing in my area.  There are cops everywhere hidden away so that if you go over the speed limit for even a second, they are there to take advantage.  

I don't speed and have no issues with this, but it just seems like an odd way to operate.  Are they protecting the public or exploiting a steady income stream?  Why are there so many cops in a rural area where crime is very low?  Do we need a cop car in every high way U-turn?  

It's really annoying and makes me feel oppressed.","This would get thrown out of court in many countries for just that reason, it's not how the police are supposed to operate in ""free"" western countries, laying in wait & setting traps. Ultimately it's self-destructive for the police as they lose the respect & cooperation of the very people they depend upon for info to do their job.",pics

I had traced the original artwork in AutoCAD and divided it into 4 sections based off of colour. I then plotted each section to my Cricut Maker to have it cut out of the wafer paper.

More coverage and faster then you have recharge points all over the place.

To make them work you have proximity sensors scattered around the area. If one area gets very hot with movement, you dispatch drone(s) to investigate the areas, a security guard gets an alert and reviews the drone footage. Say access is authorized or not, if not, the drone(s) continue to follow the areas with hot movements.

He rapresent us. And, his mandate is near to end, like less than a year if i'm not wrong",pics

Was that the vaccines sold to australia the italians reneged on?,no,pics
Probably a vaccine he stole from Australia... Italian pikeys,"Nope, you are totally wrong on this statement:

- He was vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine, while the vaccine that was blocked from exporting to Australia was the AstraZeneca (AZ vaccines aren‚Äôt given to elderly people due to lack in testing in older people)

- The vaccines weren‚Äôt stolen from Australia, AstraZeneca is behind schedule with their vaccine deliveries and the doses that were bound to Australia have been relocated to make up for those delays. Also they were relocated for the EU common vaccine pool, not for just us greedy Italians 
 
- Even if they were stolen, this man has no power in the decisions about those topics, they are competence of the prime minister and his ministries",pics
Maybe Italy should start thinking about some shortcuts to speed up their painfully slow and mismanaged rollout.,Italian vaccination results are better than EU average,pics
"Too much focus on ""optics"" today and what ""looks right"" instead of doing the right thing. Presidents are more important than regular people.","President Sergio Mattarella is very important and Italians know that, but the value of each life Is the same for each Citizen, from the president to the last inmate. This is also in the costitution and is the reson why Italians don't have death sentence.",pics
"cause he's only the president. In Italy, the Cosa Nostra's bosses got the vaccine even before it was discovered",Easy to generalize.  As if I regarded Americans as a gang of fat guns.,pics
i thot italy had a king tho..,Unfortunately we haven‚Äôt had a king since 1946 ;(,pics
Is every countries president old as fuck or is just USA and Italy?,"He's the president (head of state), not the prime minister.

"While this seems so virtuous, it's actually stupid and dumb. Why do we make believe that all people have equal value in a society? This guy is the PRIME MINISTER. Which private citizen is so haughty to think that they are more important to the people of Italy than the Prime Minister? Why can't we all grow up and realize that we give certain individuals more responsibilities, and thus they become (albeit temporarily) more valuable to the society than others?

To all the idiots who believe otherwise, take this basic example and think about it: if you were making a wedding and only budgeted for 100 people, would you only let in the first 100 people to register and screw your family, friends and inlaws? Really? Come on, man.","> This guy is the PRIME MINISTER

No, he isn't. It's right there in the title. They are not the same thing and they are not the same person in Italy.

>Which private citizen is so haughty to think that they are more important to the people of Italy than the Prime Minister?

The people who make the laws and rules are making them for every Italian citizen. If they say that the rollout has to proceed from healthcare workers to vulnerable people to old people and then essential workers and everyone else in the end, that's how it goes. The protection of important politicians and public figures has been achieved by the safety and precautionary measures allowed by the things they control, like their collaborators, salaries, and the offices/living spaces that the State gives them, but for the vaccines the rules are the same for everyone because the national and regional governments decide.",pics
"I'm sure I'm wrong, but enough with the soon-to-be-dead people and let us who actually have 40 years plus left have a shot","You could easily die today. Or tomorrow. Do older people not deserve as much of a chance to live and survive a virus as you do?

"It is insane to me that the sentence ""like other 79 year old citizens"" is normal.  Why are we letting people over the age of 65 run countries.  And I am including the U.S. in that equation too.

Am I jaded to think he definitely got it already and just got it again for optics?,"No, you are an idiot",pics
"That's fucking stupid if that's the case, he's an elected official, he was elected by his people for a reason and the same why they need physical protection, he needs the vaccine due to a potential threat to him to keep him alive.  This is irresponsible of any leader and government to do this to think ""He's one of the people"". That's not how it works. 

I know people want to bitch about who's getting it first and who isn't.  Get the people at least who make the decisions we put them in charge of taken care of.  I get that sometimes they don't represent you well...that's for you to voice though and also vote for next time.","Damned if you do, damned if you don't.",pics

"Good PR move, but an objectively dumb decision.

The health of the head of state is inarguably more important than that of regular citizens, simply for the fact that it helps run the damn place.",He has no power on day to day operation and he doesn‚Äôt need a pr move because he is elected by the parliament and won‚Äôt run for reelection,pics
is that the same dude who had bunga bunga parties?,"Actually, It's the same dude who saw his brother murdered by the mafia and lost his wife to cancer.",pics
"Had no shortcuts, but got the vaccine before millions of people, interesting.","Got it when it was his demographics turn, like how I‚Äôve had mine and millions haven‚Äôt",pics

"Ah, so that's why they repossessed the vaccines heading for Australia","Repossessed vaccines were relocated in the EU as a whole, also they were the AstraZeneca vaccines, while he got the Moderna one",pics

It's great. How did you do that? Please explain.,"Removing spots, rips, stains, etc:

Use the stamp tool to select an area that looks similar to the spot but without the damage and apply the new area to culprit.

Alignment:

Rotate and use Distort to straighten out edges.

Overall quality:

Use Exposure, Highlights & Shadows, Curves, Brightness & Contrast to the point where the highlights are sharp, the darks are vivid but there's still detail left in-between. Use Smart-Sharpen to clear up any blurry sections in the photo.

Coloring:

Two ways to do it. The destructive way (Fast but you can't change it in the future) would be to simply trace out the sections you want in a certain color and apply a color filter to it with the color you want. Rinse and repeat until you get to this.

Or you can go the nondestructive path (Slow but you can keep improving it) and once again trace the areas, but now, create separate layers and fill in the spots with a color that corresponds to it (trees = green, etc) and use the transparency slider to play around with it.

Misc:

Use Color-Range to pin-point small and spread out sections that need to be the same color.

Use Color-Replace to make fine adjustments within a layer to certain accent colors.

Use Burn to darken sections of the photo that came out too bright but you know should be darker.

I could go on but those will get you pretty far.",pics

"22 year old Elizabeth L. Remba Gardner, of Rockford, Illinois, Class 43-W-6 WASP (Women Airforce Service Pilot) at the controls of a Martin B-26 'Marauder' medium bomber. Harlingen Army Air Field, Texas, 1943.


About her Experiences‚Äî

""My name is Elizabeth L. Gardner, or for short, Libby Gardner. I am a pilot for the Women Aircraft Service Planes. a.k.a. WASP, which is considered a civil service. Before the war, I was a housewife and a mother who stayed home to take care of my family. I was called to duty when the war started to learn how to test planes, instruct pilots, tow targets used for anti-aircraft artillery practice, and assemble planes. I was grateful for the opportunity because it made my childhood dreams of flying and fascinations with planes a reality. I work 7 days out of the week and some of those days happen to be better than others. When I first started learning, I was eager and nervous and also had two days of training under Lieutenant Col. Paul Tibbets who later commanded the B-29 that dropped the first atom bomb on Hiroshima. The training consisted of three phases; primary, basic, and advanced. On the days that we have check rides, a lot of pressure can be put on us women, and we feel that we must make a name for ourselves in this industry. I had a check ride the other day, and I must say that things did not go so well for me that day. The man testing me was very quiet and sarcastic and did not give me much information or say a lot to let me know how I was doing. I would make mistakes as turning to far out or using too much rudder on the turns; I did my best to relax, but his sarcastic remarks did not make it easy and different items in my performance were still sloppy including my stalls. The only good thing that came from that test was my landing; it was possible that he would give me credit for that, but instead he stepped out of the airplane without saying a word about whether or not I passed. I held back my tears. The opportunity is wonderful, and I love doing this every day.‚Äù",Ohh...I thought you were calling her a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant,pics

 I think that means my brother might qualify. Is it any vet or the vets that meet the current requirements?",pics
Getting your vaccine in a supermarket is the most American thing.,"I know right. My sister works with a population that she needed to get the vaccine at the beginning of Feb. I took her to her appointment and it was this long car caravan operation...

Both experiences were not what I would typically expect of a vaccine situation.",pics
Congrats.  May i ask how you qualified and how long did it take to get an appointment?,"I don't qualify. Last week I called a bunch of local pharmacies let them know I didn't qualify, but asked if I could get on a list in case someone misses their appointment, or they opened a vial and needed to give it to someone before it goes bad....

Most pharmacies didn't have a list I could get on. The ones that did have a list still prioritized by age and other things. I put my dad on the same list as I and they called him first, but the day after I put us both on the list his age group was able to get the vaccine and he already had an appointment for today.

A bit later the pharmacy called me and I had to race to get there.",pics
How can this be surreal,"It just doesn't feel all the way real. I've been living in covid lockdown, I only see my sister's fam and we're masked the whole time, I'm young with no underlying conditions. I felt like I wasn't going to get my vaccine for a long time. Plus there is the relief of not getting or giving covid to people I love who might get really sick from it. Then you add that it wasn't a planned shot, I had to rush to go get it.

[removed],"[Obviously all lives matter. No one said they didn't](https://i.imgur.com/UyCmhSx.png). However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can. COVID-19 is still a very real threat, not only to you, but those you love and everyone around you as well!

"On the surface it appears that you are in the right place but there's still a lot of problematic things going on here.

Young girls don't start out liking ""pink"" and ""dresses"". It's suspicious that she would have picked out, coincidentally, a pink car on her own. At a young age you could have been talking to her about how she doesn't have to like pink because ""she's a girl"". 

Same thing with the dress, why encourage that she conform to gender stereotypes at such a young age?

Are you sure that this is her choice and not the box you're putting her in? Don't underestimate your biases and influence and toxic traits, they can't be covered up with a couple of bumper stickers.

Why does the ""big man"" need the big gun? Had to give her the ""small girly gun""?

Being progressive and forward thinking is about positivity. I recognize that you may be in a conflicted phase of your life right now, the image is a juxtaposed combination of toxic masculinity with sprinkles of evidence that you may want to better yourself and change.

Lots of fucking presumptions in your commentary. Perhaps the other young girls she associates with, and/or her female relatives, influence her to liking pink (and in this case, I will say, ROCK IT). Or maybe, you know, she does just simply like it.  
  
Are you so obtuse that the scaling of the awesome Dinosaur nerf guns fits rather well with the body sizes of both of them? The big gun may be unwieldy for her significantly smaller arms and hands.

> Both opal and agate are silica-based minerals, but agates have a crystalline structure, while opals do not.

Someone want to ELI5 why this woman is dead and Brittany Spears' daddy controls her life after a buzzcut? Anybody?,">Someone want to ELI5 why this woman is dead and Brittany Spears' daddy controls her life after a buzzcut? Anybody?

The people around Amy let her, or did nothing against her, increasingly worse, drug addiction. Some of them, allegedly, helped her continue down the path of self-destruction. They were more concerned about profiting off of her work than taking care of her as a human being.

Britney Spears' father was able to seize control of her assets and earnings after she had a very public breakdown when going through the toughest period in her life and he has been unrelenting about giving any of that control back. Britney Spears has asked courts to give her more control over her earnings multiple times but has seen very little success in her appeals because the law  that allowed him to take control over his daughter's earnings is very hard to disprove in a court of law.

A few years ago she walked away from a very lucrative contract to perform at Las Vegas as a regular and stated she wouldn't perform again until her father gave her control over her earnings again. Her father maintain his position to this day.

In my opinion, I think it's unlikely Britney will ever have control over her life or money unless her father blows through all of her money and needs more or whichever judge next looks at her case makes the reasonable choice.

TLDR; on Britney - her father manipulated and controlled most of her life and took advantage of his daughter during the hardest period in her life instead of helping her out. He enjoys having access to her vast wealth and maintains that as long as she's pampered enough she shouldn't really be complaining about it.",pics

They fit over the handlebar (and shifters and brake levers), then we slip our hands down into them. (The pogies stay on the bike when we get off.)

"I've been here! (USA guy here, pardon my excitement)

My extended family lives in one of these houses. We jumped from the deck into the sea on a ""summer"" morning instead of taking a shower and by pure coincidence missed an entire swarm of jellyfish only moments later. We also hiked to the top of that domey rock in the back of the photo. Stunning! On a clear day, supposedly Scotland (Shetland Islands) is visible. Norwegians always have afternoon coffee and dessert, so my (distant) cousin hiked all the way to the top with a big thermos of coffee and a box of sweet biscuits, much to our joyous surprise. 

My parents backpacked here in the 80s for their honeymoon. This road didn't exist - there are an absurd number of bridges mostly built in only the last 20 years - and no mobile phones. So the story goes they just turned up one day and waited for a few hours until a little motorboat came by to pluck them from the mainland. Fascinating to think about.

All newer households (and most older ones too) are hooked up to a local water supply - a small dam, I suppose you can call it. From there it goes in ...pipes are a bit generous.. tubes I guess, to the various areas (and parts of this system is under sea water).

"Would this be considered a wealthy neighborhood, house, with docks and a private road maybe?  Curious.","Not particularly, no. Roads are municipal. I bet most people living there are making pretty average salaries, maybe a bit above average. It's pretty remote, so the well-paying jobs aren't in great supply.

"This looks very, very expensive to buy and maintain.","Maintain? Nah. Granted, there is salt spray,  and more wind than average.

Source: Family home one meter from the sea is pushing 300 and still has some mid-19th century windows left.

Buy? Depends. If you want a house like this as a holiday home, it can be expensive. However, some homes in places like this come with a clause committing the owner to actually living there, which at least helps keep the prices down. Another big help is that many Norwegian villages are hemorrhaging young people to the urban centers; if you can find a job in a rural area, many places have homes left empty, and relatively low prices.",pics

" **More info:** *""President Barack Obama dined in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Monday with CNN personality Anthony Bourdain, whose Parts Unknown food travelogue is one of the network's most popular nonfiction series. Bourdain met with Obama to discuss the purpose of Obama's trip to Asia and his interest in the people, food and culture of Vietnam, CNN said. A huge crowd gathered outside the restaurant Bun cha Huong Lien, then let out a cheer when the president came out. Obama shook a lot of hands and waved repeatedly before vanishing into the motorcade. Bourdain later tweeted that the meal cost $6, and he picked up the check.""* \- Associated Press \[2016\]",I am amused that they clarified it was a nonfiction CNN show.,pics

""In the mid-80s, HIV/Aids terrified the world because of a lack of understanding as well as misinformation.

In April 1987, Princess Diana opened the UK's first purpose built HIV/Aids unit that exclusively cared for patients infected with the virus, at London Middlesex Hospital.

In front of the world's media, Princess Diana shook the hand of a man suffering with the illness.

She did so without gloves, publicly challenging the notion that HIV/Aids was passed from person to person by touch.

She showed in a single gesture that this was a condition needing compassion and understanding, not fear and ignorance.

John O'Reilly was a nurse on the ward at the time of the Princess of Wales' visit.

He spoke to Witness about a landmark moment in the fight against HIV/Aids.""","And in the Thirty years since then, we have made impressive progress, up to the point where we safely can say that an undetectable viral load equals it being untransmittable in any form. (undetectable = untransmittable)

"As an actor in Hollywood in the early 1980s I found myself at the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic when it first struck.  In 1980 I was directing a play and one of my actors, a deeply closeted gay man, kept missing rehearsals because he kept getting sick.  He told me he had ""picked up some kind of weird virus that the doctors can't identify"".  He had to drop out of the show and three months later he died, only the third diagnosed victim in Los Angeles county of the newly identified AIDS virus.

The epidemic struck with the force of a storm and a diagnosis was a death notice.   Doctors quickly realized that the highest risk people were IV users who shared needles and gay people.  Beyond that we didn't know how easily the virus could be contracted.  Even though I wasn't in either of the high-risk groups I was still afraid.  It wasn't known if it could be spread by contact as casual as shaking hands or drinking from the same water fountain.  At first, it was unknown if it could even be airborne and just being in the same room as an infected person could be dangerous.  We just didn't know.

While producing at a repertory theatre company we worked with the Hollywood Gay and Lesbian Alliance to do a number of fund-raising performances benefitting the Alliance.  As a producer I worked on each event with the Alliance's volunteer chairman to organize the events.  In a two year period four of those men died of AIDS.  Two more actors in my company, dear friends both, also died.

Between 1980 and 1984 I lost 14 friends, co-workers and neighbors to AIDS.  After that I just lost count.  The fear in those early days was palpable.  If you weren't there you can't really understand.","Channel 4 recently made a brilliant miniseries about the AIDS epidemic in the 80s called It‚Äôs A Sin.  It‚Äôs written by Russell T Davies (Queer as Folk, Dr Who) from his experiences of being a young gay man in the 80s.  It‚Äôs one of the most moving TV shows I‚Äôve ever seen and I can definitely recommend it, if the subject matter isn‚Äôt too painful for you.

"The experience wasn't the movie, it was the entire process.

It's Saturday afternoon, mom or dad mentions something about renting a movie and the seed of excitement is planted.  Everyone would pile into the car and off we'd go.

You would spend 45 minutes to an hour just scanning through titles, excited about a new movie but kind of anxious over it being terrible.  That was the gamble.  You could rent a couple of movies, but if you picked a shitty one, too bad for you.

In many cases I found movies that turned out to be great that I might turn off now, simply because it was the movie I had to stick with.

My interest in horror was sparked from sneaking off to the horror section and looking at the cases.

I have such deep and powerful nostalgia over renting movies.  It's something I'll never be able to replicate with my own children.",Someone should open a bar that has racks like this of all the latest releases.

Then I finally decide, but alas it‚Äôs NOW an exclusive for a streaming service I don‚Äôt have. So then I sit down to negotiate with myself and decide if it‚Äôs worth buying.

The ""illegals"" moniker was a recentish GOP change to what was previously described as ""Undocumented Immigrants"".

To steal their children. 

American citizens smuggle people and drugs. They still enslave children and sexually assault them. But those people are not ""illegal"" and they are treated well if they have the right connections.

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

I assume you used photoshop?

Some areas have distinct strokes and others look like a photo that had been blurred like in the eyes and around the teeth.

Reading a lot of comments debating whether digital painting is equivalent to traditional is maddening. It‚Äôs like listening to couch potatoes debate about whether martial arts or ballet takes more skill‚Äîy‚Äôall never get off the couch you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. 

As someone who prefers oil painting, but sometimes digital paints, I can say they‚Äôre just different. Each has unique challenges. I find oil painting easier actually, though there‚Äôs something to be said for layers and ‚Äúundo‚Äù buttons in digital. 

Regardless, digital painting takes the exact same skills. Both require careful brush strokes and direction, shading, mixing‚ÄîBITB require the same principles used to convey perspective and dimension on a flat plane. 

Basically, I think people only diminish a skill set when they either have no concept of its requirements, or are insecure in their own skills so they have to jerk themselves about how much more difficult it is. Ignore the fuckers. 

Artists shouldn‚Äôt diminish other forms. Non artists should go back to watching tv with a hand down their pants and save their uninformed breath.
