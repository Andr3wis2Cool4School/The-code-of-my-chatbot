"How does the professor know you’ve completed your Pokédex?

Isn’t the whole point to go discover Pokémon? How do they know you’ve truly caught them all?","Lol. I had this discussion in our college Pokémon group. The consensus was that the Pokédex is prefilled and you are just like an assistant running around to update it and verify it. For example in Let's go games you record the heights and your Pokémon can be of different heights, so what you are doing is collecting data about it but there is preexisting data.

Again, none of this is official, it's just a discussion we had day before when we were talking about the protagonist doing unpaid work for the professor, similar to an unpaid internship.",pokemon
So I'm going through Pokemon Ruby again and decided t look up a walkthrough because why not and saw that they have maps of the routes [like this](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/6/60/Hoenn_Route_111_RS.png) And I was wondering if anyone has ever made a huge map using the ingame routes? instead of a fanmade or the PokeNav map,Yep.

"Does the Shield expansion pack dlc affect anything mid-playthrough or is it all seperated? I'm about to start playing shield, but want to know if I can hold off on buying it until I complete the main story.","The only ways that the DLC can effect the main playthrough is the Galarian Slowpoke event at Wedgehurst Station, the Style Card changing what appears in clothing shops, and that Pokemon introduced along with the DLC can show up through online things like Raids and Surprise Trade. There's also a minor in-battle effect; NPCs using the move Metronome ([for example, Beauty Anita](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Galar_Route_6)) have a chance to call DLC exclusive moves (Most notably, ones associated with Legendary Pokemon like [Sacred Fire](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sacred_Fire_(move)) or the Isle of Armor tutor moves).

"I played Gen 1 a ton as a kid, and Gen 2 a little bit, but I haven't really played any of the other main line games. I want to play through them all, but I'm curious if you guys have recommendations about which versions to play.

Also, should I play the remakes (i.e. Heart Gold, Fire Red, etc.)?","I would for sure play heart gold/ soul silver. Many people, including myself, consider them to be some of the best Pokémon games.

I've always been a fan of the Pokemon TV shows but I’ve never played an actual Pokémon game before. Which games would you guys recommend and for what reason?

Yellow is available on the 3DS as a ""virtual console"" title but it's the original game so be warned: slow and very technically limited.

Let's Go Pikachu (or Eevee, they're the same game) is on the Switch. It's unique among pokemon titles in its catching mechanics, which are changed from most of the mainline games to be more similar to Pokemon Go on smartphones.

"Am I missing something, doing something wrong, or is my luck just this bad?

Ok, so a couple months ago I decided that I wanted a Shiny Ditto in a Master Ball. I have never shiny hunted before so I looked up the best way to do it. For reference, I do have the shiny charm.

I decide on using the Recycle Munchlax method and SOS chaining them. I did notice that there was a little bit of differences in the actual data mined numbers of how low you can get the spawn rate (some say 260ish and other 680ish). There also seems to be a discrepancy in whether or not the chain resets at 255 or not. 

So, I have been trying to to get this bastard for more than 2 months and have killed over 7k over them. I have had chains that vary from exactly 255 to over 1700. I wasn't sure if by having to ""reset the chain"" I had to leave the battle and restart in a new battle or if I could continue on so I tried both. Several times. 

I don't know what I could be doing wrong. I do know that the chain method is working somewhat because after 20-30, I start getting the Imposter dittos popping up a lot.

You might ask how I know that I have killed that many. Leppa Berries. I started with 992 (-7 for my Hypno to Switcharoo) and I am down to 253. I am using Pokemon over lvl 70 so I can one shot them as they come.

Like I said. I am at a loss here. I have no clue if I missed something, doing something wrong, or if my luck just sucks that terribly. 

Any help would be appreciated.","If you're playing in the original Sun and Moon, then the shiny odds reset every 255 or so encounters. For the Ultra games there's no reset. It's easier to just keep the chain going.

Assuming you're following the guide, there shouldn't be anything you're doing wrong. 

There is a very small chance that you might have missed it. If you aren't paying attention, it is possible that a Shiny Ditto appeared that happened to have it's hidden ability Imposter, making it immediately transform into your pokemon. In that case, the Ditto would not appear shiny. There's also a chance that a Shiny Ditto just used Transform to transform into your non-shiny Hypno and you didn't notice.

If this didn't happen, then you are getting extremely unlucky. I don't know what to say.",pokemon

"Replaying Emerald on myboy advance with the Emerald Final patch (makes all 386 available, mechanic/QoL updates, HMs don't need to be taught, no difficulty/trainer changes.) 

I just swept the flying gym but I'm still having trouble with rounding out my team; 

Swampert/38 (starter)

Blaziken/40 (hack places this 1% encounter rate VERY early on, 2 hours to find one.)

Manectric/37 (glass STAB cannon lol)

Swellow/37

Aron/27 - TRASH. I've put decent TM moves on her but she's still so weak on top of SLOW to level.

I'm thinking Shroomish in sixth and replace Aron with Trapinch. I'm a little concerned I won't have coverage against psychic later in the game, but doing Hoenn-only pokemon limits the option pool for Dark to basically Absol. I'm not struggling, but I want a full team of gen 3 mons by the time I hit the Elite 4. 

Help.","Breloom is fantastic, but I'm afraid you'll have Aron's problem with the Trapinch line as well—its experience gain is similar to Aron's, its line evolves even later than Aron, and Vibrava is offensively weaker than Trapinch. Flygon's stats are a little underwhelming for evolving so late (its Attack is the same as Trapinch's) and you already have Swampert as a Ground-type. Adding Flygon with Breloom would give you three Pokemon weak to Ice with only Blaziken to resist it.

It looks like Emerald Final adds a physical/special split by default, otherwise I'd suggest using Bite on Manectric to solve your Psychic coverage problem.

Breloom is a fantastic Fighting-type, but not such a good Grass-type, seeing as his Special Attack is horrible and in Gen 3 he doesn't learn any decent physical Grass moves except Bullet Seed. ~~If you're looking for a useful Fighting-type and some Psychic coverage, you could consider Heracross—it's decently fast, only a little weaker than Breloom, and has Megahorn to deal with Psychic-types~~ never mind, Heracross is Gen 2 and you want Gen 3 only sorry lol.

You could also consider using Medicham instead. With Pure Power, its Attack is effective just a little lower than Heracross's (but still excellent for Gen 3) and it gets all of the elemental punches upon evolution! If you have the physical/special split disabled somehow you can teach it Shadow Ball by TM to take out Psychic-types.

Gardevoir is another option too, since it can learn Shadow Ball, and with the physical/special split enabled, that nice Special Attack will hurt other Psychics pretty badly.

Another alternative, if you want a Dark-type for the immunity to Psychic, is Cacturne. Cacturne is a great mixed attacker and learns some good moves, but is very slow and frail, and only gets Faint Attack for Dark-type STAB, so you're probably better off choosing someone else.

Another Dark-type option is Sharpedo. As long as you don't mind having two Water-types, Sharpedo has great attacking stats and Speed, learns Crunch through level-up, and can learn some other useful attacks through TM.

Overall, the only Psychic users you'll need to worry too much about are Tate and Liza, and all of their Pokemon have secondary weaknesses your team already covers, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. Hope this helps!",pokemon

"Did people enjoy the wild area more than the routes and towns in Sword and Shield?

For me these open areas are interesting in limited quantities but I enjoy the density of the regular routes more. I think areas like Glimwood Tangle and the Falinks puzzles on route 8 were just as interesting as the giant expanse of grass and water in the wild area. For me, there should continue to be a mix of routes and open areas. One thing I particularly disliked about the wild area was that I never interacted with half the roaming Pokemon because there was no point. While random encounters have their drawbacks, the wild area basically removes any surprise factor of running into a random Pokémon. I think they have to solve that issue in the next game if they want to make this work.","SWSH routes and towns are terribly empty. I prefer the Wild Area simply because the rest of the game is so linear.

Red & Blue, Gold & Silver, Crystal & Yellow","Recently played through Yellow and Crystal- Yellow gives you Pikachu as a starter and access to Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander; if you want to build a team like Red’s, I’d recommend getting Yellow. Red and Blue are more traditional, pick one of three starters and build a team around em. I’m missing some differences, (possibly story elements with Team Rocket) but there’s enough there to try out both (either Red or Blue AND Yellow). The difference between Red and Blue comes down to some Pokémon unavailable in either, googling a list would be your best bet there.

When it comes to Crystal, there’s some more content there (Suicune quest, Odd Egg with increased shiny odds, Dragons Den) as opposed to Gold/Silver, and if you’re buying on Virtual Console (3DS) then you get access to the Celebi event as well. There’s some aesthetic changes too- minor, but they’re there. This time, there’s really not much point in Gold or Silver, as Crystal is largely the same plot wise, just with additional content (think Emerald as opposed to Ruby/Sapphire, but with even less difference between the two base games and much more reason to play the third installment in the generation). 

If it’s a decision about which to play, I’d say Red/Blue (doesn’t matter which), Yellow, and Crystal. If you’ve already played FireRed or LeafGreen, skip Red/Blue just play Yellow and Crystal. 

Or play all of them, they’re all awesome!

Masuda breeding is nearly always the superior method in terms of results, as you can guarantee your shiny has 5IVs and the correct nature.",pokemon
"How many Pokemon are there total, including all variations and forms, but excluding ones that are simply cosmetic (like the bazillion Spindas)?

extra move)

"Requesting a game suggestion!   Thinking about Platinum, White, or White 2. 

My preferences on games I'm familiar with:

RBY - Classic. Too slow to revist

FRLG - Peak pokemon.  I'm a gen one purist but I've played it out too much.

Lets Go Pikachu - Recently traded in after getting half way through.  Hated the controls. 

Heart Gold - Enjoyed Johto for the first time and burnt out halfway through Kanto.  Thought the idea of going back sounded awesome, but I'm just burnt out on Kanto I guess.  Hoping for a good fresh post game in what I play next. 

Emerald - Enjoyed a good bit.  

Omega Ruby - Played this most recently and thought it was quite good.  Wish there was a bit more post game.  Kinda got bored hunting the legendaries and dropped it soon after beating the elite 4. 

Pearl - Didn't love gen 4 at the time, but appreciated certain aspects of it. Lots of nolstalgia here.  I'm very excited for the remakes. So excited I decided to finally play platinum when they were announced.  

Sun - Didn't finish the first island.  Was extremely excited and extremely let down by hand holdy cutscene hell.  Also these new, mega evolution, Z moves, dynamax mechanics are cringe imo but I understand it's a kids game after all.  Let me explore!


So I'm excited for the gen 4 remakes.  But I got to thinking that platinum might not be the best idea right now because I tend to burn out and I might not want to play the remake when it launches.   So the alternative is gen 5.   It's appealing for a lot of reasons but I'm wondering if I should just skip to the sequels and play White 2.  The idea of playing White and only having new pokemon is cool and all, but in my experience the second iteration of a generation usually comes with a lot of QOL updates.   I don't want to repeat what happened with Gen 4 back in the day.  I burnt out on Pearl and then didn't play Platinum which was by many accounts a much better experience.

TL;DR - If I choose Gen 5 should I skip to the sequel? Should I go for the nolstalgia trip now and play platinum like I should have ten years ago?",sounds like you answered you own question. i think White 2 is a perfect choice for where you're at,pokemon

Alolan Meowth normally evolves via friendship, but LGPE doesn't have friendship so it just evolves by level in that game.

For Nincada's evolution into Ninjask and Shedinja, Gen 4 added the requirement that you need a Poke Ball in your bag in order to create the Shedinja.

Second method is more recent, namely directly from Pokémon Go to Home via the Go Transporter. Depending on the Pokémon (level, legendary or not, shiny or not) this takes energy which recharges over time, so the number of transfers is limited but you can transfer every Pokémon except costumed ones.

SWSH has lots of cutscenes and handholding just like SM. The battle animations and the character models are mostly really cool but there are some glaring ugly moments. 

The Wild Areas are really cool, but theyre designed for you check them every day to find item spawns and run raids. so theres not much to do but its designed to be done repetitively",pokemon

"Hey there, I'm currently doing a pokemon platinum nuzlocke and I can't stop thinking about cyrus' gyarados that's coming soon-ish, Right now my team is frosslass, crobat, gyarados, gastrodon, gallade and magnezone. the answer to that gyarados would normally be magnezone... except gyara is faster and has earthquake, so my plan would be switch from magnezone to my gyarados to dodge earthquake and tank the giga impact when switching back to magnezone, then kill during the recharge turn. Now here's the question: How does cyrus' AI works? will he always go for the most powerful move or is there a chance for him to go for ice fang instead to try and weaken me before going for GI?","According to [this Smogon Forums post](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/pokemon-platinum-trainer-data.3665884/) dated June of 2020, while we can determine the value of the AI ([and Cyrus in that battle has the strongest AI level of 7](https://pastebin.com/PB7J63bT)), it isn't well understood what those values actually translate to mechanically. There may be better understanding of how the AI works since this post was made, but if there is, Google is failing me in finding it. Speedrunners are generally the first ones to get a good understanding of that sort of thing, so maybe try asking r/PokemonSpeedruns. My gut tells me there is no way to guarantee what moves Cyrus will use when.  


That does not mean you don't have options. The most notable one is giving a faster and less risky Pokemon an Electric coverage move. Froslass gets the Thunderbolt TM, which you can pick up by surfing behind Valley Windworks or from the Game Corner, and Gallade can learn Thunderpunch from the Move Tutor west of Pastoria City. Neither of these strategies are foolproof, however: Gyarados has high special bulk (increased by its Careful nature) and Intimidate, so depending on how much grinding you've done, there isn't a way to guarantee an OHKO with either of those Pokemon. These options are also high commitment, either costing a valuable TM, a lot of money at the Game Corner, or a lot of shards depending on which way you go.   


There are also ways to give Magnezone a greater chance to succeed. A Shuca Berry, combined with Magnezone's high Defense, will likely let it survive one Earthquake. However, Shuca Berries can be hard to obtain. You have a random chance of getting them once per day from an NPC in Pastoria City (I am unsure of whether or not you can soft reset for this), and they have a 5% chance of being held by a wild Ponyta (you can increase the odds of encountering wild Pokemon with held items if you have a Pokemon with the Compoundeyes ability at the front of your party and then steal the item with Thief, Trick, Covet, or Switcheroo). If you can get rid of his Houndoom (and, if you're afraid of Heat Wave, Honchkrow), you can also use Crobat or Weavile to set up Defense boosts via X Defends, and then simply tank the Earthquake. Manipulating which Pokemon he sends out when is tricky, however, and both strategies (especially the X-item route) may fail due to a critical hit.   


I don't think you have a way to 100% guarantee a clean victory without large amounts of grinding, but there are a few options available to you that can make your odds of success higher.",pokemon

You will need a second device in the 3DS family of systems to do this for the 3DS games, so your DSi will not work for that. A 2DS is probably your cheapest option for a second device.

Transferring from Gen 4 (SS/Diamond) to Gen 5 (White/White 2) can be done with both devices you have currently; you just need to get to the Poke Transfer Lab in the Gen 5 game, after getting to the credits. Transfer from Gen 5 to Gens 6 (X/AS) and 7 (Moon/Ultra Moon) can be done entirely on your 3DS, though you will need a subscription to Pokemon Bank, and need to download its companion Poke Transfer app. Once moved to Pokemon Bank, you can move Pokemon to either Gen 6 or 7, but keep in mind that Pokemon moved to Gen 7 cannot go back to Gen 6.",pokemon

i need help finding a platinum emulator that wont give my laptop computer aids,try /r/emulation,pokemon
I’m looking to get back into the games. I’ve been steadily playing PokémonGo but I haven’t played the actual game (console game I guess?) Since ruby on the advanced. I had an emulator a while ago I but have since gotten rid of that computer. I don’t want to buy another system so I was hoping someone could point me to another emulator and a game that has more that one region.

"I'm seriously sorry -  this has probably been answered a million times... I'm seeing pokemon is making a comeback (or rather just becoming the talk of the town again) and potentially looking to offload my set. Just want to see what kind of value I have here. I want to walk into a local card collecting place that buys these types of things but want to make sure I don't get too ripped off.

I have the base, fossil, and jungle set with some rocket and gym heroes. I really do apologize for not being able to describe everything in depth, it would take forever.

But - I have what I think is the full sets of those from Charizard to Blastoise and Venusuar etc. Probably about 700-800 cards. I'm going to (hopefully) link a picture of the holos I have but again to go with say Charizard, I have the charmander and charmeleon.

What I dont have are trainers and power ups or whatever they were called? Again, I'm sorry, I went hard on these in like 1998, 99, 2000 and that was it. Took them out of the packs, straight into sleeves, and left them alone since so all great / like new condition and tons of duplicates.

Waiting for new pages of sleeves and reorganize / put duplicates in their own sleeves so also looking for suggestions on how to organize the cards best. Alphabetical? By number at the bottom?

The best shiny chance is in ORAS, since it's the only game where Unown is available after the shiny rate was upped to 1/4096.

"Should I start with Pokemon Emerald or SoulSilver?

I've loved playing Pokemon 1st gen when it was released and again with FireRed. I've never finished OSC even if I started several time and liked it.
Now I just bought Emerald and SoulSilver since I saw they were considered as the best ones but I don't know with which one I should start.","If you have a love of the Kanto games, you may want to start with Soul Silver, since the Johto games are direct sequels of the Kanto games. They strike a good balance of having both new and old Pokemon, and the plots of the two games tie into each other.   


The one thing to keep in mind is that from a battle mechanics standpoint, Emerald is probably a little closer to what you are used to. One big change implemented into Soul Silver is the physical/special split; whether or not a move is physical or special is not determined by the move's type, but is rather an inherent property of the move. A move like Waterfall, for example, is special in Gens 1-3, but physical in Gen 4, while a move like Hyper Beam goes from being physical in Gens 1-3 to being special after Gen 4.",pokemon

\-Some mechanics from previous games, like Mega Evolution and Z Moves, do not exist in Sword and Shield.

The ""ultra"" versions of the games are the ""definitive"" editions, with more Pokemon, more postgame and non-story features, and a different resolution to the main story's climax. They still follow the basic story beats for the first 3/4 of the game or so, but all things being equal, the ""Ultra"" versions are probably the most bang for your buck.

The differences between paired versions like Sun and Moon ([besides a few in game mechanics](https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/versionmisc.shtml)) mostly come down to a few version exclusive Pokemon.

Finally the 'moe' in Moemon is a Japanese term for feelings of affection for cute, usually female, anime characters.",pokemon

Holy crap not only are we getting gen 4 remakes we're getting AN OPEN WORLD POKEMOM GAME also set in sinnoh this is beyond my wildest dreams,Everyone was so apprehensive coming into this lol. I doubt there will be too much complaining aside from fps in the arceus game,pokemon
"Honestly, I prefer this new aproach, the main team works in a new big game every 2-3 years, and in the meantime we get small games made by other companies.

In theory they nailed and exceeded my expectations. But I hope these games improve visually.,Legends especially is going for the old watercolor style so if it's polished up a little it can be as beautiful as botw. That and the frame rate can be improced although I think that is a purposeful choice like Spider-Man miles morales.,pokemon

Anybody else see the leaks??? I’m PUMPED,"Me, me, me! I'm excited for a big reason but I don't want to spoil it so I'll come back after the reveal and edit this post as to why.

"Opinions on remake art style?

On one hand, I kinda like that it looks similar to the original games, with the short sprites in the overworld, and mixes it with full art on battles.

On the other, I don't know... not convinced.","I'll give it one thing, it's definitely the most efficient art style they could have gone with.",pokemon

And the Arceus game looks really promising, too! The feudal-Japan setting is something they haven't tried since Pokémon Conquest (which was a great game btw) and having three starters from different generations is a nice concept. Seems like they are experimenting with some things that are completely new to the main-series games, let's hope those gambles pay off!",pokemon
"Here's my wild, super crazy prediction:

>!There will be, at least, one person disappointed!<",pokemon
That starting video showing off various stuff from Pokémon's history was a amazing,It was way too long. It felt like half the presentation was just that recap montage,pokemon
this Arceus game looks amazing and is 200% the direction Pokémon should be heading,Minus the framerate,pokemon
I love that they are making the open world action rpg people have been asking for forever without making it out of the main series. The main series still has the turn based combat that competitive players love while pokemon legends will hopefully be the better singleplayer game other older fans want.,Legends seems to have unchanged combat.,pokemon
Am I the only one here who'd really love an expansion to Gen 6? Feel like it's the least acknowledged and expanded upon gen. Maybe just me,"I'm totally biased because Y was my first (and personal favorite) pokemon game but same here! I feel there is so much more story that could be told, and I'm still slightly bitter about not having a pokemon Z lol",pokemon
"Curious why they didn't stick with the ~~BOTW~~ SwSh art style for the remakes (wonder why I have BOTW on the mind). But lord, Pokemon Legends looks fantastic","Because they know they can get away with anything as long as there is ""pokemon"" in the title.",pokemon
"Thoughts: 

Pokemon snap: looks fucking amazing. Cannot wait. 

Gen 4 remakes: honestly disappointed with this one. Graphics look meh and worried that “keeping faithful” to the originals will mean nothing new to explore and no expansion to the game. Hoping that’s not the case 

Pokemon legends: okay the graphics look suburb. Interesting choice of starters. Worry is lots of space but empty space. Aka no city’s or other villages besides the starting one making the game really one dimensional. Hope I’m wrong about that. 

Overall: Excited but cautious. 

What do other people think?","I just hope the Pokemon in Legends behave as interestingly as in Snap, that would be amazing. Open World games tend to feel a 
bit empty though if done wrong.

For the remakes: I’d be fine if they add Platins Post game to it and do nothing more. Strongly expect they won’t even do that though.",pokemon
This is some Monkey Paw shit,I wish Sinnoh remake wouldn’t change anything.,pokemon
"I hate to be cynical, but I wonder what content they removed in the remakes","They said faithful so probably any positive change they made for platinum, like additional fire types",pokemon
I think what worries me most about dp remakes is if they are 100% faithful with no changes besides graphics why wouldn't I just continue to play platinum?,"Agree, on top of disliking the art style already I didn't like how they showed NOTHING new or hinted at nothing new. 

ORAS remakes had new mega-evolutions, cosplay pikachu stuff, the post game content w/ rayquaza, etc that warranted a purchase

How can I get hyped when they didn't hint at anything new? Even platinum aside, why not just play the original diamond and pearl again? Am i gonna pay $60 just for GTS access again?

and yeah it would suck if the games did suffer from same original issues of DP (like no fire types)",pokemon
If these leaks are true. Consider me hyped,Where can I see the leaks?,pokemon
"My predictions:

the fandom will not stay civil regardless of what happens

that concludes my predictions for the Pokemon Presents","Well, I guess most people, at least here, are pleasantly surprised.",pokemon
"rowlet, cyndaquil, and oshowatt as starters?? ok!","It surprised me, but I'm actually really digging the idea of having starters from different generations.",pokemon
Very worried how Legends was chugging along with two pokemon on screen. I can't believe BOTW was on the same console,Weren't pokemon just straight up stuttering during that? I'm definitely going to wait on reviews first.,pokemon
"Is anyone else's stream lagging like crazy?

Don't know how to feel about the Gen 4 Remakes too, not a fan of the artsyle. And for the Arceus game, it's cool to have an open world pokemon game. But those frame rates and resolution though. It looks similar to BotW in terms of the world, so I hope the game runs better on release.","It was incredibly laggy, I switched computers and turned on 4G on my phone and was still having issues.",pokemon
"Just realized the starters they chose (Samurott, Typhlosion, Decidueye) all have a feudal look to them.","Samurott, especially. He’s a perfect fit for a game in this setting.",pokemon

-No Dynamax, which im totally fine with 

-No Mega Evolutions. Kind of sucks. DP would be the perfect place to have it with the underground and whatnot 

-no following pokemon... I mean comeon, especially with this downgraded 2d style, should be super easy to do..","How do you know that for sure though? We didn't get to see that much. Just because they didn't show it in the initial reveal doesn't mean it isn't there. Mega evolutions are kind of unlikely (they've been gone in Sword and Shield, no reason they'd bring them back here), but the following Pokemon is still possible.",pokemon
"If we get anything about Gen 4 remakes, it will be preceded by 19 minutes and 45 seconds of Unite.","The screen fades to black, and you hear a scream “SINNOH IS REAL”",pokemon

"Damn I'm I the only one bummed that the remakes are more akin to a remaster, being too faithful to the original?

HG&SS and OR&AS brought so many nice additions to the games, and the possibility to have all the pokemon available at the time...

Excited nonetheless just wish they loved this remasters as much as we do. They used to.","No, you’re not.

"The chibi style I can look past, but is anyone else finding the *animations* to be weird? They're extremely stiff, and even the ""finished"" animations are awkward. The overworld animations feel like prototypes. When they run, their head is almost static, but when they walk, they bob left and right, which looks dopey as all hell.","I agree. I hope these games get a lot more polish, but I'm afraid the 2021 release window won't leave them with enough time to release a good product.",pokemon
"Legends arceus seems interesting, but I am incredibly concerned about the scale of the game as well as the actual gameplay. They only mentioned ONE town, and if the wild area was anything to go off of, GF does not know how to populate an open world. They should take some advice from the people who created Pokepark Wii, honestly this game reminds me of it for some reason.

Meanwhile everyone will probably shit on BD/LP for the chibi look, but it has the massive advantage of being a faithful remaster of the best region in the series. 

I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if the reaction to these two games swapped by the time both released. Mark my words.","I disagree with you on the D/P remakes, but I think you make a good point here with the Arceus game. People are hyping it up just because it looks like Breath of the Wild- but it's not like the Breath of the Wild team is developing it or anything. It's base mechanics look good, but I think people are jumping the gun a little bit on assuming this is gonna be the best game ever- crappy open world / game design could easily ruin it, and we don't know enough about that so far. That being said, they still have like a year to develop it, so from what they have it looks good. I hope the next trailer will go a bit more indepth.",pokemon
They figured out the Dialga/Palkia statue! This is gonna be a good game!,[Manga did it years ago...](https://external-preview.redd.it/EywpbDuRL-gSCfoaYBYfRp4mykRiMO0g9O5Y4LEUIMw.jpg?auto=webp&s=795dcf7843f708349d3380e2f859fadc98c50030),pokemon
I think the gen 4 remake has a cute charm to it tbh,Reminds me of Link’s Awakening.,pokemon

Ready to be heartbroken!!!!,Pokémon fans and anger. Name a better combo,pokemon
"NON GAMEFREAK GAME

I REPEAT, ILCA IS MAKING THE D/P REMAKE",That's a smart move.,pokemon
"So could we see Pokémon legends becoming a franchise? Because with Celebi being featured heavily in the snap trailer, I can’t think of anything cooler than going to ancient Johto in an open-world game.","I think Johto would be the perfect region for this, but since Arceus was introduced in gen 4, it makes sense it's Sinnoh",pokemon
"Art style is legit how Diamond and Pearl was before. Chibi in overworld, regular proportions in battle. It looks cute, and at least it’s not made directly by GF this time.","Yeah, having played Diamond literally in the last month that is actually a really good representation of it on 3d.


Now of course is when people realize they weren't fans of that style to begin with I guess though.",pokemon
The fact that live chat is disabled for the video does not mean they are expecting backlash they are more worried about abuse in the comments,refresh your page and live chat will be enabled friend,pokemon
Ok so the remakes look trash but that Legends game? That looks amazing!,"i quite like the aesthetic but I get what you mean. Legends does look amazing! I'm really hype for both honestly, we finally get the nostalgic remake and pokemon legends really makes sw/sh look like shit in comparison (aesthetically) but i suppose only time will tell if the gameplay will also have an appeal (looks solid so far, a bit choppy but I'm sure it's just an early access version)

I'm just hoping they omit the interactions with pokemon go and also remove combat power. Add back breeding and evs. The catching mechanic is great tbh.",pokemon
the frame rate on those wild pokemon animations were looking pretty choppy on the legends game.,"Yup, about like Breath of the Wild it looks like. Probably will run similar once it's fully developed, hoping that the ""Super Switch"" rumors are true and we can experience these games in better framerates",pokemon
Wow.. that remake style is HIDEOUS,Character design is a bit off but I like the rest of it. I've missed top down pokemon.,pokemon
"I think Legend Arceus is the only game that I will accept the Dexit to be happen.
I mean a lot of pokemon only can appear in modern society: like the Voltrobe line, Klinklang line, or the Ice-cream pokemon, or that fairy key pokemon, muk and koffing etc.
I wonder what line should be cut off.","Apparently Klink came before gears, which were also ancient inventions. Keys and pollution were also around in the 19th century.",pokemon
WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE THAT,[deleted],pokemon
"Oh god, the framerate is atrocious.","Yeah the idea is great for an open world Pokémon game, and people are hyped because this is what they wanted, but...when you really look at it the game looks terrible.",pokemon
I'm hesitantly hopeful about the openworld Legends game. I like them showing the player hiding in the grass and throwing the balls but is that going to be a necessary feature? I want some of them to be skittish and require some amount of stealth to catch. I also would love some of them to be aggressive and come for me similar to the chasing done in Sw/Sh. I feel like they're just hamming that aspect up though and we can just run at anything within a distance.,dude I'm just going to take it haha it looks fun,pokemon
"Not at all thrilled with the art style of the Gen 4 ""remakes"".   


I know maybe a lot of other people are pretty pumped, but I gotta say I am severely disappointed.",Yeah I can't understand how people can be happy with this tbqh. Graphically it's a downgrade from Lets Go Pikachu/Eevee in every way.,pokemon

Arkeus lol,...have I been saying it wrong this whole time?  Is Arkeus canon?,pokemon
The open world looks awesome. I’ve never played diamond or pearl but I don’t think I’ll dish out $60 if it’s essentially a DS game playable on the switch,"although that 60 might be cheaper than diamond and pearl rn, currently it's a little over 100 dollars",pokemon
My stream ended and It started show a clip of the anime about some guy talking about Magikarp I was so confused lmao,its back up,pokemon
"I feel empty inside, I barely felt excited ;-;","I feel you. Sinnoh (more specifically, Platinum) was my childhood, but I fell of the train during USUM and after SwSh I can't be hyped for new games anymore; only cautiously skeptic.",pokemon
"Ok so apparently the new abbreviation is BDSP, and i keep on thinking BDSM","We already had DP, SM, and SS. These types of abbreviations are a thing.",pokemon
"There’s a difference between “terrible graphics” and selecting an art style. Looks like the Gen 4 games are sticking to a Link’s Awakening art style so hopefully it looks super crisp on the Switch. 

This Arceus game looks absolutely amazing though",Links awakening has a plasticine aesthetic that is quite pleasing. This just looks low effort. The grass surrounding the lake is square.,pokemon
Don’t make me choose between Rowlet and Oshawatt,Cyndaquil is best boi f8t me.,pokemon
"Long video showcasing all the main and side games ever, and they didn't even mention Gale of darkness or Colosseum.... We're never getting a sequel, are we?",Nnnnope lol,pokemon
"So they’re taking the Link’s Awakening approach to it. I’ll accept it. 

Legends looks hype though.",Pretty much what I thought too,pokemon
How did I know that the second I saw the *slightest* bit of lag in a YouTube video with tons of people watching that people would latch onto that? Lol,"It was, to be fair, a significant amount of lag. My stream flat out crashed near the end.",pokemon
"Legends seemed great at first, but then I realized:

- ""in this era, people have journeyed to Sinnoh from all over and founded a prosperous village""...

- ""with the village as your base...""

The game will be one huge Wild Area with one single town, won't it?","Oh god, I hope you aren't right.",pokemon
Imma just say it; I really hate the art style of the remakes. It just looks so weird to me. It worked with pixels but it ain’t working in 3D.,"Ur not alone

Edit: just saying, compare links awakening to these remakes. Same style in both remakes, but one screams more quality than another",pokemon
Why do the Diamond and Pearl remakes look so much worse than Lets Go Pikachu/Eevee or Sword/Shield?,I think they're trying to maintain a semi-unrealistic style. might help with the nostalgia factor. its also very cutesy animal crossing-esque,pokemon
"Hype train has not only left the station, but barreling through the countryside at light speed",chu chuu,pokemon
Sinnoh Remakes killed the stream,Thought it was only my internet acting up lmao,pokemon
"I can't believe 90% of the comments are complaining. Snap, DP remakes, and Legends all look great.",Do they though? The graphics on the remake are definitely a step backwards. And Sword already wasn’t an amazing looking game.,pokemon
"BDSP having chibi humans in the overworld again when that hasn’t been a thing since ORAS is kinda weird, hope the game isn’t just “DP, but in 3D on the Switch!”

Legends Arceus looks interesting, and that book cover seems to show some of the area around Sinnoh?","What were your hopes for the D/P remakes?  To me, a graphical update is about the only thing that should be expected from a remake.  It is, after all, a remake of the original game.",pokemon
that art style is.... questionable for 2021,Agreed.,pokemon
If there’s Sinnoh we better get the underground back or we riot,I saw a clip of the underground!  It’s there!,pokemon
Its like Pokemon's version of Breath of the Wild and Link's Awakening.,I gotta admit I was thinking similar things.,pokemon
Sadly seems that BDSP doesn't have following pokemon.. :(,"yea a bit disappointing given they made the graphics a much more simplified version, I'd think it would've been easier to do.",pokemon
Wait is it over?,"The stream ended in the middle of a presentation, so either it died early or it was killed for showing too much.

Yet to be seen which it is.

Edit: it just crashed. The full video was later posted.",pokemon
"So when they say faithful remakes of the original games, does that rule out any of the Platinum stuff?",Kinda sucks of it does. These remakes should always be the complete versions.,pokemon
I’m hoping the rest of the Pokédex will be available through these two games. I’d like to be able to use my whole collection at some point on Switch,"yeah, my pokemon Home feels like a depressing graveyard. it's sad to see a lot of my favourites like my first level 100 (colosseum plusle) and my beedrill just sitting there with a cancel symbol",pokemon
"I’m not a fan of the artstyle of the Sinnoh remakes, but how are people focusing on that and not the fact that we’re getting a fucking open world Pokemon game?? That’s more exciting than literally anything ever announced by GameFreak",It's the thing we've been waiting for since Sword and Shield,pokemon
"Did I miss it or was there zero reference to Colosseum, XD, or Battle Revolution in the 25th anniversary montage? C'mon GameFreak you put the *Pokémon Mini* in the montage!","They showed *Pokemon Stadium*, which is not dissimilar",pokemon
"Pokemon Legends Arceus looks pretty amazing and basically like what we've been asking for. This is certainly the sort of experimenting with the franchise that I can get behind. With the given title, I guess this technically isn't part of the ""main"" series, but I'm more interested in this than anything that I've seen from the main series in a long time. We'll probably not see any non-Sinnoh Pokemon in this title, but that's fine by me given the setting and new gameplay elements. All that said though–and this could be because it is still in development–the visuals in the trailer looked very rough in certain areas.

On the less impressive end of the spectrum, we got our Diamond and Pearl remakes, but with a dash of Monkey's paw. I'm not sure what they're going for with this; I don't think anyone wanted literally the exact same game with low-end 3D models instead of sprites. The originals look better (imo), and other ""remakes"" like ORAS and Let's Go put more effort into at least upgrading visuals (although downgrading other aspects). Maybe players who didn't experience the original could enjoy it at least. I might consider it myself despite my grumpiness about the visuals if they've added something substantial to make it worth a return trip, but I have doubts about that given the track record of previous remakes and the fact that this appears to have been handed off to a different developer.","> I'm not sure what they're going for with this; 

What they are going for is - Link's Awakening sold well.",pokemon
"I'm kinda hurt in a weird way. DP was my first game, and favorite game, and all I wanted was a regular DP remake. I've excused anything bad Pokemon has done w DP remakes in mind, and now I'm kinda sad. This art style will grow on me, and I won't be so harsh in the future, but this isn't really what I wanted art wise. Legends: Arceus looks cool af tho! I'm gonna breed my original Infernape from DP to play w his legacy in the new games!","Same here. I wanted something like ORAS, where the coolest elements of gen 8 would be brought into Sinnoh (dynamaxing, wild area, camping, etc.) but hopefully with some improvements too. But we got what we got, and I really don't like the artstyle of Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl. Worse yet, it doesn't look like anything else about it is modernized: no post-gen 4 Pokemon, no Dynamax, probably just some updated smaller features like reusable TMs and stuff. Honestly, I'd rather play the original games. And I can, thanks to hanging on to my old 3DS and stuff. So I'm not gonna buy it, and as someone who's been defending Pokemon for a long time, I thought I would never say that again (last time was in 9th grade, cause I thought I was too old to enjoy games like that anymore, lol).

Legends: Arceus, on the other hand, while it rubbed me the wrong way at first, being a bit too different and more detached from Pokemon tradition, it seems, does have originality going for it. Overall, I'm putting all my eggs in the Legends basket for now. As crazy as it might seem, I think that game might end up having a pretty cool story. Hopefully, it'll live up to its potential.",pokemon
"This is me WAY over speculating, but if Legends Arceus does well, I’m hoping this leads to more prequel type games for each region, exploring the origin of the legendaries (not including Mewtwo or Genesect since they’re man made)",XY prequel with Kalos war would be amazing,pokemon
Sorting this sub by new and all I see is people complaining. I love this community.,People finally get what they want and then move the goalposts lol.,pokemon
Okay but I hate that artstyle... I figured it'd be a let's go Sinnoh game. It looks worse than Let's Go,"Seriously, the originals look better.

For Kanto, HD, for Sinnoh, chibi. I love favoritism.",pokemon
I kinda wish Diamond and Pearl had their old look tbh. I miss the style of the older games,But it is the old look,pokemon
"Jesus fuck that remake looks bad holy shit.
Legends looks like they are finally going in the right direction.",i really would've preferred a port of the original DP compared to the abysmal remake,pokemon
[deleted],"Everyone wants hyper realistic all the time, and it feels weird to be in the minority that also likes cartoons and that style of animation . It reminds me more of the early days in gaming, but polished.",pokemon
So the remake looks very low effort. Legends looks ambitious but the switch is clearly struggling with it.,"Legends looks like it has the potential to be the thing that leads to the next big thing. Like a tech demo before they do a full blown open world game in present day. Plus, it doesn't launch until next year. I'm sure they'll work out the frame rate situation by then, right?",pokemon
"I really dislike the art style of the Gen 4 remakes. I was hoping for something along the lines of Let’s go Pikachu and Eevee’s art style. The ‘Chibi’ as I believe it’s called doesn’t appeal to me. 

Another point, when they said faithful recreations, does that mean there is no distortion world? Only 5 fire type Pokémon and no Looker? I know I’m pretty much describing Platinum here but I can’t believe they would remove features from these games.

I’m a proper negative nelly here someone please reassure me.",The art style basically mirrors that of the originals. They were chibi then too.,pokemon
I hope when they say BD and SP are faithful remakes that means that they keep the underground local multiplayer mini game! I may be a minority in this BUT I LOVED ME SOME UNDERGROUND.,Hopefully it's online multiplayer as well.,pokemon
The only thing better than the aesthetics of BDSP is the flavor of the salty tears of people who think it looks bad.,"To be fair, the number of people concerned over it's visuals does mean they went the wrong direction. I think it looks fine, but there's no question a large percentage of people don't agree",pokemon
It looks so bad,It's not finished,pokemon
The remakes look so bad...,Yeah there’s just no original charm to it lmao,pokemon
I find the style very ugly.,better than the trying to be realistic one,pokemon
"DP remakes look ok, weird art style.  Hopefully not $60.

Arceus Legends looks like it could be amazing but was it just me or did the graphics look blurry af?","> Hopefully not $60

Hahahahaha",pokemon
"""Pokemon Legends - Arceus"" looks like EVERYTHING fans have asked for. The name worries me though, it seems ""episodic"" like this will be a small amount of content and then they'll release ""Pokemon Legends - Regigigas"" later as DLC or something. But if it truly is BOTW meets Pokemon, GameFreak will have redeemed themselves in every way imo.  


SO HAPPY that the DP remakes aren't being made by GF. The chibi art style is weird but I get the vibe the new developers will be extremely faithful to the originals. I doubt there will be much cross play - they said ""All the pokemon in the Sinnoh region"" which comes across as ""no national dex"" to me.",The graphics for battles honestly look worse than sword and shield and the world looks so empty. I honestly hope this is a very early version.,pokemon
Anybody else think the original DP graphics look better than this?,Yeah. They showed some water on a route in and it looked like something off an N64.,pokemon
I genuinely can't put into words how disappointing it is to wait 10 or so years for a remake to one of your favourite games of all time. Just for it to be passed off to a different company and turned into an ugly 3d reskin.,I am with you... I was shocked... Just not in a positive way.. I really thought it was a troll video to hype us up for the real thing...,pokemon
Is discussion about the leaks prohibited? I haven't seen any in the sub yet 🤔,"Hi there! Discussion of leaks is permitted, so long as the threads are properly labeled that they are unofficial leaks, don't put spoilers in the title, and stay contained to threads specifically about leaks.",pokemon

"I love everything about Pokemon Legends. Especially as it could be a brand new off branch of the series going forward. Only weird thing is opening the series with Arceus, surely if its a series that's gonna be built around the series legendary pokemon you would want to build up to Arceus rather than have them straight away?

I don't know about it being outsourced though, as much as I like the chibis, the trainer and Pokemon models seemed to lack proper lighting/shadow. Hope it will get as polished as Snap remake does (which looks gorgeous). Samurai Sinnoh concept looks really cool, hope it doesn't end as empty as the Wild Area in Sw/Sh.",It just doesn’t introduce anything new to merit them even being called remakes. That’s what is disappointing here. ORAS is leagues beyond this,pokemon
The Shining Diamond/Brilliant Pearl aesthetic reminds me of the Link to the Past remake on the 3DS.,It's more similar to Link's Awakening on Switch than it is to ALBW.,pokemon
"Holy shit, Pokémon Legends: Arceus looks like everything I was asking for since Switch dropped, I even wanted a Pokémon game in the past, like Conquest, and they did it. Since the release date is 2022 it looks like Pokémon is ditching the idea of “generations”.","I feel like Legends is going to be a story heavy spinoff, but this first one is GF's experiment for the future engine/gameplay of the core series. 

I'm sure we'll see Gen 9 eventually, but I'd say we are still in Gen 8. They're just not rushing to get to Gen 9 this time",pokemon
"We saw Porygon-Z in the trailer, which is a Sinnoh evo that was not in the D/P Dex, so I assume they’ll have the full Platinum Dex","Hope so, D/P had some issues with its dex that Platinum fixed (fire types in particular)",pokemon

"I’m very curious about the decision on the starters for Legends. Mostly Cyndaquil. Rowlet and Oshawott have final forms very fitting of a feudal Japan theme. But not so much Cyndaquil.

Not complaining of course, but it’s curious.",Probably the most popular non-gen 1 (or gen-4) starters from each type,pokemon
"When they say faithful, does that mean the sinnoh remakes will remove fairy types? That will be a big deal if the Fairy Type is removed","I doubt it, probably just in terms of story and landscape",pokemon

"The DP games don’t really look like remakes, more remasters, painfully similar to the originals with a new coat of paint. Combine that with potentially no Giratina or distortion world, version exclusives and trade-only evolutions, maybe NSO required online underground and a 60 USD price tag, could be a big disappointment. Trying to keep my cynicism in check but based on Pokemon’s history, that’s just what I think’s going to happen.",That's a lotmof cynicism considering ruby and sapphire had the extra content to be more similar to emerald. No reason to expect these to be different,pokemon
"I've just noticed that they picked the 3 starters that would fit in most in a feudal Japan style setting. Typhlosion - a volcano, Decidueye - Ninja Archer, Samurott - Samurai. Pretty neat.",Except Greninja is like the most obvious pick for what they were going for and it wasn't included.,pokemon
"So legends looks amazing, people are comparing it to BOTW, but there’s one thing I seriously hope they do different

I know it’s “feudal” and supposed to be really early historically. But I really want there to be actual towns and NPCs. For as good as Zelda was, it was....empty! I still want to feel like part of a bigger community.","They mentioned in the trailer something about there being one big village. There might be more, but I wouldn’t expect much",pokemon
"Way more hyped for Arceus game than Sinnoh remakes- but did the framerate look a little choppy for anyone else in Pokemon Legends Arceus?

"Does anyone else feel like ILCA's under strict ""keep it simple"" orders from Game Freak? I feel like that would explain the chibi art style for BDSP.

"I hope ILCA knocks it out of the park. I know BD/SP is further along in development, but it looks much more clean and finished than anything gamefreak has done in the last 6 years, including Legends Arceus.

I think the remakes are perfect. They can put their effort into content instead of visuals which is what I've wanted for a while.,It was always gonna be hard to adapt the 2D top down style to what we see in Sw/Sh. I’m perfectly fine with taking the Links Awakening approach.,pokemon
"Pokemon Legends is Gamefreak doing... SOMETHING NEW WITH THE SERIES!?!?!

I am so disappointed in the art style of the Gen 4 remakes.,I love it so much. I hated the 3D design in SUMO and SWSH and have been hopping for a 3D game in the style of Link's Awakening ever since they announced that game.,pokemon
Ok other than the people the remakes look fine but Legends looks ABSOLUTELY FIRE graphics wise like what I was always hoping a Switch Pokemon game would look like,"What?? Legends looked the same as Sw/Sh, with awful textures. And the footage the use to announce the game is full of FPS drops and slowdowns.",pokemon

"I dunno, I dont like that word ""Faithful Remakes"" 
Hoping they keep in Platinum's upgrades. Dont qant another Battle Tower Debacle..","I hated that wording. It feels like we are gonna get a copy and paste of diamond and pearl and pay $60 for a game that didn't feel worth $40 14 years ago. Holy crap 2007 was 14 years ago, I'm old.",pokemon
Y'all literally got TWO Sinnoh remakes and you're still complaining....,"I don't think anyone was expecting the DP remakes to be a literal copy/paste of the originals, and in the chibi art style though.   


I think we all fully expected that IF there were to be DP remakes, they would be remastered versions in the SwSh engine. Kinda like how LGFR was in the same style as RSE, HGSS was same as DPPt, and ORAS was same as XY.  


I don't think it's wrong of me to say people are disappointed due to the chibi graphical style.  


Pokemon Legends on the other hand, I need more info on. Looks like the shake-up the series has needed for a long time, but I want to manage my expectations to avoid a let down like SwSh.",pokemon
"""Haha u wanted an oras style remake? Here's a game with mobile graphics. Die""",little dramatic there,pokemon
"Fuck the negativity, that was an awesome livestream. Legends is obviously in early stages of development, and the stream issues were obviously a thing, but the art style of both New Snap and BDSP (which I'm always gonna have to do a double-take while reading because it looks like BDSM) are great (fight me about BDSP) and Legends looks amazing as a concept, assuming they put enough effort into it. This was the first great Nintendo/Pokemon stream in ages guys, let's be positive.","cant fight you cause BDSP looks amazing. I agree it looks like Legends is still in development, but even so it looks really fun (ofc assuming they would the effort in)",pokemon

Why do people hate the art in the remakes? I think it’s a good approach for a remake.,"It looks exactly like it did before the full 3D style idk why people are pressed LOL. Chibi in the overworld, regular proportions in battle",pokemon

I don't want to just simply buy ultra balls.  I want to fid the resources and crafting recipe to make them myself.

"I’m at work, are they letting all Pokémon back in for the new game or not?",Based on Porygon Z in the reveal it looks like the Sinnoh remakes will use Platinum's dex (which had more than the other two games). I wouldn't hold your breath for Legends. Remember that this is the same company that claimed SS couldn't afford to make new models for the full dex. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news 😕 hope your shift goes well.,pokemon
I think what they're doing with Legends is a fantastic idea. I remember a lot of people being dissatisfied with the changes to the standard formula with Sword and Shield but with Legends they have the freedom to shake up the formula however they want since it's a spin off of sorts. If it's as good as it looks I hope they take the idea to other regions.,"I’m in total agreement.  With the naming of the game, and the story concept, I think they are purposely setting themselves up to do more if this game is successful.  Personally, I’ve grown dissatisfied with the direction they’ve taken with the main line games.  I couldn’t finish SwSh and not sure if I was going to find interest in Pokémon games anymore.

But if they pour their heart and soul into Legends, and create a really full experience with freedom and some departures from previous games... I can be won back.  I think it’s way overdue that GF needs to bring Pokémon into this century, and wow us with a new sense of exploration and discovery as well as classic progression and collection aspects.  

My only worry is... when did they start working on this?  Nintendo took years to develop BOTW.  The gameplay footage they showed was very unpolished and they didn’t show much of a populated, live game world.  I just really hope it’s not an unpolished, rushed, and barren disappointment like SwSh felt to me.",pokemon
"I am lowkey hyped for Legends, not gonna lie. Never played gen 3 either, so maybe the remake will be a decent way to experience Sinnoh.","Not to be an asshole, just letting you know that gen 4 is sinnoh, and gen 3 is hoenn",pokemon
I'm not going to lie there were a ton of Pokemon things I knew nothing about in the 2000s like the phone adapter?! Crazy stuff.,"It was japanese-only, to my knowledge.",pokemon
"As someone who’s first game is Pearl and it’s my favourite gen, I am thoroughly disappointed at the remake...it looks like a game made in 6 months when fans have been anticipating this for years - the art style really doesn’t do it for me and they OUTSOURCED this to a different company? I mean I will still get this but it’s leaving a very sour taste in my mouth. It’s also probably a one time play through which I might not touch again.

Also imagine charging £60 for this game which is essentially a repaint. Ruby/Sapphire vs ORAS was worth it because at least the contrast in graphics were paramount. This looks like a game that could be made in 2013.

What do you guys think? For me I’d prefer they not release Legends and have gamefreak work full force on the remake and if this is the actual product I’d rather they not announce it at all. This feels like a cheap ripoff and a cash grab. I know this is just one mans opinion but I’m sure that many share the same sentiment after looking at all the comments.","Aesthetically speaking, I don’t mind the nod to 2D pixel-era games, but the game had rather be packed with strong content (side quests and national dex). They can’t blame the console for performance issues when they’re about to release a DS game on switch.",pokemon
"But why are the graphics so bad? Why reinvent the wheel, Let's Go looked awesome?",What bad graphics?,pokemon
Will Pokemon Legends Arceus be classified as a main series or a spin off?,"Considering Let's Go is a mainline game, it's likely to be considered a main game as well.",pokemon
"I’ll be honest...I’m not super impressed with what was shown.

Dmnd/prl remakes visually seems like an attempt from game freak to get away with all of the things people complained about in Swrd/Shld, particularly in the animation and cinematic departments. “High quality animations”

Now that isn’t to say the way it looks is itself a problem. It’s style is very similar to the Links awakening remake, and I adore that game. This is more a problem with the devs reasons for why they may have chosen the art style.

EDIT: just saw that game freak is not the main dev team on this project, which makes the art decision a tad less scummy feeling.

As for Arceus, while the concept is cool and an open world Pokémon game sounds interesting, that trailer is a bit of a mess. Frame rate issues, relatively stiff movements of the Pokémon, and an all around completely uninteresting environment have me worried. It currently looks like a fan made unity project, and I fear the end product may be just as ‘empty’

Granted, that footage is from an early build, but I can still here the same comments being said about the ocarina trees in Swrd/Shld that never got fixed.

I hope I’m wrong about Arceus though","> , that trailer is a bit of a mess.

"I really enjoyed the graphics/animation in that Post Malone concert. They clearly have the capabilities, why is that not what the RPG will look like!?! It actually baffles me that I'm now a full-grown adult now and the game's graphics still haven't really improved massively.","It's a lot harder to generate those graphics dynamically. It would take a lot of GPU power to do that on the fly, much more than any console currently has.",pokemon
"Did anyone else feel like nothing happened on Pokémon Day and hardly anything leading up to it? During the 20th anniversary by Pokémon Day we had tons of announcements, distributions/events, and merchandise. This time we get a couple expensive products (Master Ball, train) and a Post Malone Concert. Did they cut the content because of the Pandemic? It all seems rather flat to me.",The distribution events for the 20th were SO FUN,pokemon
"Am I the only one who isn't a fan of the chibi style for the diamond and pearl remakes? It feels like a big step backwards for me.

I'm really happy to see a new pokemob snap game though, and the pokemon legends idea has some massive potential.","A large portion of the complains for BDSP is the chibi style. I personally would have wanted gen 6 graphics, or the Link's Awakening remake.",pokemon
"So, here are my thoughts on Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. 

I am cautiously optimistic. Even though the art style is... not what I had in mind, I don't hate it either because, like Let's Go, it's designed to be reminiscent of the original games while introducing smoother and more dynamic graphics. My biggest fear at the moment is that, if ILCA and Masuda don't play their cards right, this remake could be worse than the original. What I mean by that is, if you cut a lot of stuff from the original (like they did with Let's Go) such as post game content, and don't allow gen 8 pokemon to be brought over (it's not that I really WANT to use Galar pokemon, but all previous remakes have included the new gen's pokemon, so I feel it's important to the spirit of the game) then you end up with a game that is actually worse than the original, just with updated graphics. What I wish I could tell ILCA is that, to have a satisfying remake, you need to basically include everything fans know and love from the originals, and THEN some stuff that's new and fresh so that it stands out from the original. If it's just a clone of the original, that just wouldn't land for me. I'm currently playing Platinum on my DS lite, so just playing the same game on the Switch isn't all that exciting. Basically, I feel that if they cut too much (almost anything tbh) from the original, it's a failure, and if they add too little, it's a failure.","Yeah. I think gamefreak have already screwed themselves by showing what they did. I get the focus on faithful remakes but if there are still differences (like Pokémon available, new forms etc) then they should have given some kind of indicator that it was present. Right now they look like carbon copies of the original. That would be fine if they were only $40 but at 60 they really need more.",pokemon
"I have no idea how to feel about the new art style

And IMO a pretty dumb name (at least in Japanese)",Isn't it literally just the pokemon art style from the gameboy/DS games?,pokemon
Obviously Pokémon fans complain after getting basically everything they asked for,"It is truly incredible how toxic this subreddit it. Literally both of these things (Sinnoh remakes, BOTW style game) have been asked for, FOR YEARS.",pokemon
"man, i was hyped for sinnoh in gen8 graphics... sigh oh well",You're still getting Sinnoh in pokemon legends that looks awesome and will probably be more polished when it comes out.,pokemon
"Oh man. There's ""being faithful"" to the original Sinnoh games and then there's literally plagiarizing the original game and just upping the textures to HD.

I would have really liked them to have changed the art-style in some spots that aged pretty badly because it had to be made for the DS. They remade the battles, sure, but that's the only thing they changed to how the game looks. At that point they may as well have just ported the DS game directly.

Or, they could have gone the Links Awakening route (or the Let's Go! route) and actually made it look visually interesting despite using an outdated art-style. Now it just looks... bland.

Honestly pretty disappointing, and this is from someone who didn't mind the flaws of ORAS. At least Legends and Snap look interesting.",ORAS legit went above and beyond.,pokemon
Oh that was the entire presentation? So no Let's Go.,"""Legends"" looks like it will be a Let's Go style catch system",pokemon
"is no one going to talk about that amazing trip down memory lane at the beginning of the pokemon present, so good",*cries in Colosseum/XD*,pokemon
"the remakes actually look like a downgrade, wtf?",Seriously. The originals look way cleaner.  Better off saving the $60 you know Nintendo is gonna charge and just replay Platinum,pokemon
"I’m a fan of the art style of the remakes, I’m surprised that there are complaints about it. People have been asking for top-down Pokémon again for years, and now they’re gonna complain when they finally get it?

As an aside, Pokémon Legends Arceus is insanely exciting. Looks like a fresh change to the Pokémon formula, not to mention it looks as beautiful as Sword/Shield should have been from the start!",These people only complain I see people bitching about them having another company make are the same people who bitched and suggested it when sword and shield launched,pokemon
"The idea for Pokemon Arceus is amazing, but what was shown was... trash? It looks like a pre-alpha version lol. Don’t have faith Gamefreak will deliver a polished game.",Not unless they delay it to 2025,pokemon
is it just me or is anyone else worried that it sounds like gamefreak didn't listen to anyone for the past 5 or do years as we said we wanted a REMAKE of PLATINUM not a REMASTER of Diamond/Pearl,"tbh i heard more people asking for remakes of d/p then platinum

but yeah i hope it's not just a remaster because if it is it looks awful",pokemon
Y’all are a bunch of negative Nancies. Both Sinnoh games look like good fun,i mean the models looked pretty embarrassingly bad for d/p. plus they didnt tease any new content. imma just play the originals again,pokemon
"""Hey, the remake looks cute, kinda like Link's Awakening! Let's see what Reddit thinks about it!""

""Gross!""

Don't know what I expected.","Ehh, I dont hate the remakes, but links awakening look MUCH better. Artstyle aside, the remakes somehow looks worse than Lets Go games. Why?!",pokemon
Everyone talking about the art style as if we didn't just get a remake of gen 4 that looks like it holds faithful to the old versions. I'm so hype and so sorry the art isn't what yall liked,"Tbh I’m fine with the chibi art style if it means the graphics look a lot more polished than Sword and Shield’s. Also, not updating the graphics into the Sword and Shield engine means that the maps aren’t simplified this time around so they’re going to be faithful with the route layouts. 

Now, if they can say that this game has the post-game content of Platinum, I’d be floored.",pokemon
I’m super mixed on the style of the Sinnoh remakes,"Relate, looks kinda... too cutsy",pokemon
God those remakes are abhorrent to look at lmao,nah,pokemon
I'm going to point this out. They never said that you'll have the full dex in the gen 4 remakes. They specifically said pokemon from gen 4. If we get dexit 2 electric boogaloo this whole community goes down in flames.,doesn't look like actual main series. looks like the lets go category. it's outsourced.,pokemon
They literally just slapped a 3D filter on the original sinnoh games and called it a remake. I’m super disappointed. And Game Freak isn’t even fully in charge of developing it.,"What more do you want? A sequel? If the game was changed too much you’d complain “oh it’s not a real remake, it’s too different” and if the art style was like SwSh you’d complain “oh it’s too similar to SwSh” so I don’t get this complain. Besides all we’ve seen of the remakes is literally a trailer. The other remake trailers didn’t show off too much that differed from the game until it was almost release time.",pokemon
"I mean those **are** DP remakes and an open-world Pokémon game...Is that really enough to satisfy you guys though ? These games look awful.

If people are happy that's great, I just don't get it.

Pokemon Legends is a great idea and I'm glad they're trying at least, but so far it doesn't look too promising. And the D/P remakes look like the laziest Pokémon games ever. I hope I'll be wrong.",This sub finds new ways to complain lol its hilarious,pokemon
Am I the only one who finds this disappointing? The art style looks even more child-like than let’s go...,Remember when remakes were definitive edition of current generation? Yeah I 'member.,pokemon
Am I the only one thinking that the remakes look weird and gross? The character models are just off,It's chibi,pokemon
"Seems a bit unpolished, but I'll take it. It's been so long since og Snap.",No way this game looks incredible.,pokemon
What happened? It just ended,the full version should be uploaded. Just go back and find where it cut out for you and continue from there.,pokemon
"Legends looks cool, I know it’s early, but those animation should improve (no doubt they will). Also, the remakes look low effort to me...",Didn’t we say exactly that about the Sword and Shield animations?,pokemon
"I need a paper bag to breathe into. I'm actually hyped for Legends, it looks like they took the way Zelda changed with BotW and applied it to the Pokémon series. And I'm very excited to see that.

The toy aesthetic (like in the Link's Awakening remake) for the DP remake is going to clash with the seriousness I remember from Platinum. I'll watch how it unfolds, but I'm not willing to preorder.",I do NOT like the art style of the remakes. I was expecting something in the art style of SwSh but with more polish.,pokemon
I hate they went super faithful with the remakes. ORAS was improved so much with the likes of EON flute and the post game. Also ORAS felt like a successor and improvement from X/Y while this game looks like they went backwards from SwSh,I think they'll add some of that stuff personally,pokemon
legends needs a looooot of polish,"well it’s not coming out for almost a year or so, I’m not worried about this being the final product at all",pokemon
"I'm kinda worried about DP being ""faithful remakes"", like, are they not gonna put the improvements that Platinum added (expanded dex, battle frontier) and are they gonna limit the pokemon available to Gen 4 and below like the Let's Go games? Also I prefer SwSh's art style more.

I'm still excited tho and probably gonna buy Day 1",They did say something to the effect of “play with all the Pokémon from sin oh region”,pokemon
The Open World Pokémon makes up for the fact that the D/P remakes look like shit,What if Open World Pokemon also looks like shit? I mean it looked pretty bad here.,pokemon
"If they made the game look like Sw/Sh, people would've complained about the game not following the originals closely in terms of art style and they'd say they don't want the games to look the same as Sw/Sh which were ""terrible"" games. I mean, they did deserve some criticism over the years but at this point it seems to me like some people are complaining just for the sake of complaining and they will never be happy with Pokemon games.","No, that is simply not true. I don't know many people who actually dislike the look of e.g. ORAS. Hell, most people even find Let's go visually pleasing. Never have I heard that the remakes don't look close enough to the originals. Literally never. Many people were simple expecting an improved Sword and Shield style just like ORAS was an improved X Y or HGSS was an improved Platinum.",pokemon
"If we got a new ""Legends"" game every 3-4 years I would be happy. ""Legends: Mew"" would be off the chizzity chain.","You have a future in Marketing, at least",pokemon
I really like the direction they are going with Legends even if the footage does not look good in some places. D/P looks awful though.,DP looks fine only thing I don't like is the chibi character overworld sprites but that will just take some getting used to.,pokemon
 I don’t know if it’s just me but I really didn’t like the art style of the remakes. The actual battles looked fine but the sprites are so bad.,It's not just you haha,pokemon
"Surprised by two things, that pokemon actually delivered what we actually wanted... and that people are mad about it anyways.",Nobody wanted chibi remakes tho,pokemon
Both games look ugly and incomplete af. Also why make a renake that looks like a 3DS game with no changes at all to the story/map/design?,"Both games **are** incomplete, that's why they're not out yet.",pokemon
"Im gonna make a prediction now: Sinnoh fanboys are gonna hate the remakes and accuse them of being a shitton worse than the originals. Except most of their criticisms are gonna be issues that existed with the originals, they just couldnt see it through their nostalgia goggles","So far, the originals looks better than this so...",pokemon
"Pokémon fans “all I want are Sinnoh remakes, I don’t care about anything else as long as they get a remake.” 

TPC “here are your Sinnoh remakes you ask for every year.”

Pokémon fans “wtf noooo not like that!!!! What are you doing!!!!!”","Pokemon fans: ""Pokemon should have never moved away from the 2D overworld style""

TPC: *creates a remake that pretty much maintains 1:1 mapping with the original overworld*

Pokemon Fans: *angry face*",pokemon
I actually like the graphic style of the remakes. It's charmingly goofy like the Link's Awakening remake,"Disagree. Links awakening looked really good. Loved it, but this one, it just seems like a really low quality mobile remake. Like it should be on a low quality phone or some shitty online game. 

The art style is dogshit.",pokemon
So what is the general vibe around the models for the gen 4 remake? I know it is different studio but they certainly have quite the art style.,"Well, the same art style as the original...",pokemon
"So what exactly different between the play of legends vs SwSh? It's still turn based, but you can just throw a pokeball at a pokemon in the wild without the battle?",Open world?,pokemon
"Pokémon legends looks like straight booty guys idk, laggy, ugly, potential to be buggy.","It's super early game footage. Game isn't coming out till 2022 so it should get better, but we'll see",pokemon
"My initial thoughts

1. Pokemon Brilliant Diamond - 60 bucks for a port of a 15 years old game, no thanks


2. New Pokemon Snap - Looks good, will buy when more environments / mons are revealed towards its release


3. Pokemon Legends -  'Action RPG' developed by GF. Sees the same old 4 moveset battle screen. May need to manage expectations to avoid disappointment like sword and shield","My thought was that the ""action"" is the stuff you do to catch pokemon, and the RPG is everything else?",pokemon
"I have to ask:

Does anyone else laugh at the fact they pretty much gave the ""WE WANT LETS GO"" and ""WE WANT REGULAR MAIN GAME"" people what they wanted, combined? 

We got the main game with Let's Go Artstyle. 

I'm REALLY not sold on the art style. It literally just looks like you're playing a DS game in 3D. :/ That's not really a remake. A remake is Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire. 

I'm torn on Legends. I doubt I'll pre-order it next year, and just wait for reviews from actual players before trying to get it.",What's the point in ever pre ordering a game?,pokemon
"Today I found out the hard way that a company can listen to its fans after angering them, give them exactly what they want, and fans will still complain","Honestly. For YEARS it’s been Gen 4 this and Gen 4 that, and demanding open world games. They gave us BOTH. And it’s STILL not enough.",pokemon
"I love the look of pokemon legends Arceus, but it appears to run horrible. It could be me but the game looked super choppy. I hope they'll fix that later on, that flying Chingling looked horrible.

Edit: okay guys I know they still have a year of development left. Forgive if i remain skeptical for the moment. High hopes, low expectations and all that.",it's still a year out from launch that's more than enough time to fix that.,pokemon
"Yall OMG, I totally get the backlash at how bad Sword & Shield was, but I can't believe people are complaining after all THAT that was released today. Does anything ever make you guys happy?",The gqnes both look ugly? I wouldn't mind the chibi style for remakes if they at least had sword and shield level graphics for battles. It looks worse than the let's go games and has no shading or anything on the pokemon in battles. Also doesn't help that it looks like they're not remaking platinum or doing remakes on the same level as ORAS. The new game also looks completely empty and dull.,pokemon
Where can I get that fabric that was in the video? I need to make a mask and hat out of it!,Originalstitch.com,pokemon
Oh my god the leaks were true!,Indeed they were,pokemon
Did ya'll catch a glimpse at the Sinnoh Ryhorn?,Sinnoh Ryhorn? like a regional variant.,pokemon
"Well that I did not expect. Outsourced development, and a remake that is basically a HDified original. Let's Go art style, but presumably different catching. Also appears to be confirmation of no Platinum additions.

Legends is of course the more interesing game. Possibly the Pokemon BOTW people have been asking for? It also looks like more of a PBR / Let's Go style on the Pokemon models. Are we to lose the cel shaded style SwSh used?

BDSP - yeah, that initialism is a bit close to something else ... - I will reserve judgement on. After all the fears Game Freak would ruin it, now I fear it won't add enough new to be worthwhile. I guess I'm fickle.

Legends, for me the crux will be whether the story lives up to the world. It's something both the Pokemon series and open-world games often struggle with.",Even let’s go had better graphics than this...,pokemon
Pokémon legends looks cool could you imagine if they expanded to other regions like Unova or Kalos?,"This is why I’m hopeful that this spinoff series is Pokémon Legends, with this game being Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

I’d love to get a Legends game that shows what happened in G/S to result in the tower burning down, and what resulted in the legendary dogs.",pokemon
Why does legends have the same battle mechanics that we've had since 1996?,It would have been so cool to have an actual action rpg instead of pixelmon.,pokemon
Legends doesn't look a little barren to anybody else? Also catching pokemon just by throwing a ball at it like that? I dunno man,It didn’t look like a game that’s only a year away from release but perhaps that trailer did a poor job of showing off what they have,pokemon
Why can't they add following pokemon anymore.... Why were LGPE the last to do it since HGSS?,It’s in the SwSh DLC,pokemon
Only thing that concerns me is that they use the DP sinnoh dex which has the worst dex of any game aside from Red and Blue. There were like no Pokémon in those games,"Have to agree. 

Oh boy which fire type am I going to chose? Infernape or Rapidash?

But I can play around thatt. 

I  just HOPE they dont bring back HMs. It was terrible in Sinnoh",pokemon
"I didn't exactly believe that we'd get an actual OPEN WORLD Pokemon game, yet here we are lmao. Best of all it looks like there's gonna be an actual story in Pokemon Legends: Arceus, so maybe it'll break new ground in the narrative department too. I'm so excited to see how it turns out next year!","I know right. We are finally going away from the usual ""im a player and i battle gyms gameplay and want to be a pokemaster.",pokemon
"Wait guys. Was Porygon originally in Diamond and Pearl? Lucario attacked a Porygon Z in the trailer. I don’t think Porygon was originally available which could very well mean we get the Platinum Dex, yeah?

Edit: Just checked. Porygon was not available in Diamond and Pearl!!! That is a really good sign that we are getting the Platinum Dex",Porygon-Z is generation 4.,pokemon
The Gen 4 remakes look good. I'm personally not a fan of the Sprite design but the overall design of the region and top down approach give me so much nostalgia and I'm super excited. I'm so excited for Pokemon Legends though. Like more hyped for it than I've ever been for a pokemon game.,"The remakes give me big Link's Awakening remake vibes, it's really cute",pokemon
"I’m very optimistic about the announcements today. On one hand, the BOTW-style game is made to appease to older, long-time fans like most of this subreddit who wanted something new and more in-depth. On the other hand, they made the small, cute ones to appeal to both the younger audience as well as people who enjoyed the Let’s Go games. Branching off and taking the franchise in multiple directions at once is a smart move when the fanbase is so large and diverse with different wants and demands.",Worth mentioning that the pokemon in battle aren't cutesie they looked normal,pokemon
Idk if anyone else has pointed this out already but at 1:08 A Lucario is battling a Porygon Z. Porygon Z was not available in the Diamond and Pearl regional dex. Only in Platinum. That is a great sign that we get the updated Pokedex for the remakes!,Porygon Z was introduced in Diamond and Pearl even though it wasn't actually included in its regional dex.  So I don't think it really tells us anything,pokemon
"Slightly concerned about D&P Remakes because it's handled by an unknown company. I think it's better to just not say who is handling it. Also that game looks bad to me. Come on TPC, you know that you're going to release this game in the middle of November. Give us a more concrete release date already.

Legends however gave me a better taste in my mouth. Though there's still something that still keeps me concerned but not as much as the previous game. Maybe if we get more information, it may reduce the air of uncertainty. It's still ways off since it's slated for early 2022.","It's not an unknown company. It's the guys that made Pokémon Bank. You know, the $17 a year subscription? I'm sure we are good good hands.",pokemon
"I LOVE YOU POKÉMON! THE PAST DOESN’T MATTER!

But seriously, you have no idea how good it feels to be excited for Pokémon again. I’ll admit, I’m a little disappointed that BDSP uses chibi models instead of the realistic proportions of SM/SwSh, but I’m willing to look past it for the sake of reliving my very first Pokémon game.",">I LOVE YOU POKÉMON! THE PAST DOESN’T MATTER!

Every release since ORAS",pokemon
"The open world format for Legends is what I've dreamed about the series having since it's inception back in the late 90's.  I can't say enough how  much I'm impressed Gamefreak is going this route and how glad I am that they're doing it.... I wanna make it **very** clear that I am excited for this, hope they knock it out of the park, and want to see this format continue to be a mainstay of the franchise...

...but man, the graphical quality looked *rough*. People complained about Sword and Shield looking visually unimpressive or bad at times, but this makes Sword and Shield look polished to a sheen and next gen in comparsion. I really hope they can clean this up.

I'm not asking for, like, even Breath of the Wild level visuals, but make it at least look as nice as Let's Go or Sword/Shield itself. Honestly even the Sinnoh remakes, not even counting the chibi style, seemed like a visual downgrade from Let's Go.

I hate to be negative, because this is clearly GF actually truly trying, and I wanna encourage that, but yeah. 

Still, extremely interested in this, the most I've been in anything related to Pokemon in years by a huge mile.","I have hope that the graphics will improve. They’re not releasing it for at least another year, so they’ve still got a lot of work to do",pokemon
"really confused about the ""Action RPG"" label, while showcasing traditional turn-based combat...",Action RPGs usually means you have real time combat without any switching or cuts. Perfect example: Tales of series and YS series.,pokemon
Think Arceus will be in remakes? Azure flute finally released?,"I bet he won't be, with having his own game and all",pokemon
"“Faithful remakes”? So the remakes will still retain all the problems in DP and won’t adapt to the changes made in Platinum? Also, why did GF outsource the remake to another company?","Lmao.  ""even when it's not GF's fault, it's GF's fault"". This sub is by far the most frustrating sub on reddit.",pokemon
Think we will get later generation Pokémon in the remakes of shining pearl and brilliant diamond?,"I'd say the Pokemon that fit sure, like Sylveon because Eevee, but I'd see a vast majority of any newer Pokemon locked in post game. Something to do with the Pal Park, since it'll be useless in these games.",pokemon
"Definitely like the route theyre taking with Sinnoh. Give us a mega safe, super faithful remake of the OG games down to the art style that will have to mess up hard to disappoint fans, as well as a super experimental ""premake"" that has really high potential to shake up the formula and reinvigorate the series, but also completely flop and be ignored by everyone. 

At the bare minimum we fans get a solid remake and at best we get 2 amazing sinnoh experiences, while TPCI gets 2 revenue sources along with feedback on where to take the series next. Good stuff honeslty",">mess up hard to disappoint fans

Reading this sub, fans are already disappointed with the art style. I personally am OK with it because SwSH looked ugly AF for me.",pokemon
No one's talking about that Sinnohnian Rhyhorn? Or maybe Ancient Rhyhorn?,oh whats the timestap for that. i must have missed it,pokemon
Does “faithful” mean no fairy type? And steel resisting dark and ghost? And tweaking?,I'm guessing it means story wise and map layout will stay the same. I'm sure they will modernize types and hopefully add a few more fire types,pokemon
In Snap 2. Anyone else think the Magikarp jumping in the air in front of a waterfall is a nod to the first? Knock it on the waterfall and it becomes a Gyarados?,I'm hoping this is the case.,pokemon
Did anyone else notice a blue Rhyhorn around the 13:46 mark?,"I think that was just the graphics being weirdly saturated or blown out. Still, I like the look of it a lot better than the remakes.",pokemon
"I'm so glad Pokemon Legends didn't start with  Kanto idea (I.e. Mew Origins) because we're definitely tired of first gen.

Can’t believe they didn’t go for the JoJo reference,What Jojo reference?,pokemon
I really hope BDSP (that’s a very unfortunate anagram for the game) isn’t too fateful to the original. I’d want something new.,"Yeah, should have made it Let's Go, right?",pokemon
"I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty disappointed in the remakes. I hope that doesn't make me an asshole. The sinnoh region is my favorite of all time, and it had the most potential to utilize retouched/enhanced SwSh graphics. I really really really do not like this frickin' chibi style. It just looks like Diamond and Pearl, thicc version. It's literally the exact same as D/P but just bigger. Areas and Maps are the exact same. I've already played those, I want an enhanced experience. I don't know if that sounds demanding, but that's what I've come to expect from the other 3 remakes.

The Arceus Legends looks amazing, I hope we get to see some actual lore that's been hinted at like from X/Y and stuff. I do love that they look like ninjas. As much as I am looking forward to this game, I can't help but wish they just combined the two games. The graphics and areas of Legends with the remakes. 

Seems it is an unpopular opinion, I'm honestly surprised the chibi style is as loved as it is, considering how hated the SwSh graphics were.",">The Arceus Legends looks amazing, I hope we get to see some actual lore that's been hinted at like from X/Y and stuff.

Okay but did anyone else notice how in the BDSP videos the statue in Eterna City looks like Dialga and Palkia fused??,in the original games the statue was also a fused version,pokemon
"I'm really excited for all of these games! However, I have to wonder why the graphics of Snap look fantastic, but Legends and the gen 4 remakes look low resolution.","Well for starters, you're on a track in snap. It's also a smaller game so less other things to focus on.",pokemon
Do y’all think the DP remakes are gonna include the ability to battle online competitively? Have a national dex? Or is this like a single player port?,"The trailer showed the union room, which had something to do with online, plus the underground was very built around playing with other people",pokemon
Did anyone recognize the music from the pokemon legends reveal trailer? I was curious if it was something from diamond and pearl,Felt like Azure flute but not sure,pokemon
I really hope they fix the lack of fire types for the Gen 4 remakes.,Your choices are infernape or rapidash.,pokemon
What’s everyone’s thoughts? Do you think we’ll get to bring over all our Pokémon finally or it’ll be limited to the sinnoh dex?,At the moment I think it might only be the 493 available at DPs original release. We'll have to wait and see,pokemon
"Its weird that they chose rowlet, cyndaquil, and oshawott. I love cyndaquil and oshawott and rowlet is pretty cool but why them specifically?","The final evos for Rowlet and Oshawott fit well with the ""Feudal Japan"" theme, so maybe that?

All I need to hear is if the 4th gen remakes will undo dexit and let us import any pokemon from home. If not I'm still boycotting game freak product. If it does though I'm buying both day one,Dexit was going to happen sooner or later. It had to. And it's here to stay.,pokemon
No mainline game coming? Sorry a bit confused about the remake and spinoff only being the two new games announced,"There's always a mainline game coming.

Never seen pokemon could someone tell me the right way of watching it?,"This thread is for the newest pokémon direct, which is focused on the games since pokémon day is when the first games were released.

so are all the animations and overworked stuff from sword and shield just scrapped? or are they moved over to brilliant pearl and diamond,You can see the new animations in BDSP.,pokemon
"I think its interesting that starter Pokemon will become actually viable to find and catch in the wild in Legends, even saw Chimchars in the background. And being able to catch Pokemon without the need of a battle is a plus. All in all this game seems a lot more of what I was expecting from SwSh.

That being said, and controversial opinion here, I hope they make shinies easier to catch. Grinding for hours on end is becoming more and more cumbersome, and some shinies are just plain outrageous to try and catch in the wild. Especially when you have to prep extensively for it. Like in the case of making sure to bring a Pokemon with Damp for any Pokemon with Self Destruction, Explosion, etc. Since the motto has always been ""Gotta Catch em All"" thats always been my primary draw to the franchise since I was little, and I just hope this time around they make that a bit more viable. That would make this the perfect Pokemon game for me. I have terrible RNG luck and got about 4 shinies out of Sword. My friends have managed better and since some of them play Go they have been able to transfer a treasure trove worth of Shinies to their game.","It has become increasingly easier to catch shinies now, with USUM's 1/3 chance and Dynamax Adventure's 1/100. So hopefully the odds will increase.",pokemon
Does anybody know why the gen 4 remake models look like Bratz Babyz???? The resemblance is uncanny and you won’t be able to get it out of your head.,I see it more as Funko Pop figures,pokemon
Did you also realize that poor Porygon does not yet exist during the Pokemon Legends Arceus time frame?,"Huh, I guess there are a few man-made ones that wouldn't exist. Never thought about that, interesting!",pokemon
"A ""leak"" a while back claimed the sinnoh remakes would be called Eternal Diamond and Infinite Pearl. Does anyone else think these names would've been better choices than the actual? Brilliant and shining are good ways to describe each gem but eternal and infinite are good ways to describe the time and space themes of each game. Plus they seem more marketable imo",Eternal may be a too-complicated word for non-english kids?,pokemon
the buffering was buggering.,"I just learned what that is. The Pokémon don’t have all their animations yet, so they jump to the key frames like a slide show",pokemon
God the chibi artstyle is a no from me,"Complete utter no, can’t believe I waited so long for this ugly ass crap",pokemon
Graphically-wise everything looks terrible except Pokémon Snap lol,A part of myself want to believe they are still on development and aren't finished yet. I've been waiting years for this game and I hope that isn't the final product,pokemon
Hopefully the legends game looks better than it did in the presentation. Those graphics are pretty awful right now,"It did also appear to be in early alpha, so grain of salt.",pokemon
"I'm sure most people hate chibi but this is a deliberate art direction to cater to new generations of kids learning about Pokemon.

In another word, they dont care about someone like me (30s, would buy the game anyway) but they think my 7 years old kid would love chibi style.",I think they’re just trying to be faithful with how the trainer overworld sprites looked back then.,pokemon
Diamond and Pearl look like low effort garbage,Looks like a Wii shovelware game.,pokemon
Am I the only one who’s a little let down by the diamond and pearl remakes they just don’t seem as good as the other remakes we have gotten over the years on the bright side legends looks cool af,"They just palmed the games off, the world looks okay if you like that, but lets not kid ourselves it pretty much a lets go game without the catching of lets go. Pokemon are ripped from Sw/Sh and trainers look goofy.",pokemon
I can live with every part of BDSP EXCEPT the ugly overworld characters. They look like cheap collectable figurines ffs,They look like Animal Crossing or Mii characters,pokemon
I called in sick to work so this better be good,Oof.,pokemon
"Wait, did it abruptly end?",Yeah it cut out for me right as legendaries were being introduced.,pokemon
"They didn't have time fix up the legends game, it looks choppy","Just remember it's an early show of it, hopefully those issues are sorted further in. It looked way better than SwSh in a lot of areas too.",pokemon
"""New Action RPG""

But it's turn based???",? yes?,pokemon
"Sinnoh remakes look absolutely awful. The art style just made the original into 3d as if that's supposed to make it look better. They're supposed to update the graphics and make it look the way people imagined the games looking, not make it look worse. Jesus christ. They outsourced the remakes to one of their most beloved games to make a shitty open world game. But.. but it's in Sinnoh, no it's in a completely different unrecognizable version of Sinnoh with starter Pokemon from other gens and none of the same characters except the protags. I fell in love with Sinnoh because of the version that was presented in the original Gen 4 games, not this feudal shit. God this makes me so upset.","I'll be honest, the Arceus game *did* catch my eye. I appreciate that they're switching things up to that degree and trying something new, especially since it'll lend to a lot of potential for worldbuilding on a larger scale. The idea of seeing the pokemon world at different points in time has always been something I've wanted more of since the fourth movie, so feudal Japan-era pokemon has me interested, for sure.

BUT

Holy shit, the gen 4 remake looks really, *really* bad. Like, inexcusably bad, and I'm shocked how many people here I'm seeing defend it. X and Y came out *eight years ago* and still had a better grasp on shading. The style aside (I'm not a fan of the chibis conceptually, but I know that's a personal preference), there's no reason for everything to look so flat and unshaded. Initially I came in partway through and thought it was on the 3DS, to which I was giving it a lot more credit, but when I realized this was for the switch? *Holy shit.* That's inexcusable, there's no reason for it to look that bad. Look at the difference in how the lighting and environment is affecting how the pokemon look in [X and Y](https://i.imgur.com/xc08fr8.png) vs [this shit.](https://i.imgur.com/zPSYm4p.png) The pokemon don't look like they're even a part of the environment, really, they're so brightly lit-up like they're out in a sunny field, even though they're supposed to be in a torch-lit *cave.*

They'd better not be thinking of charging full price for the remakes. $60 would be fucking outrageous considering how half-assed and lazy it looks. We know they can do better, and they're choosing to shovel out half-baked, cheap, lazy products because they know that people will buy it no matter what. Even after all the criticisms that got levied at Sword and Shield, they *still* decided to pull this? It honestly feels condescending.",pokemon
"Damn, the remakes IMO look godawful, if i wanted to play ""faithful remakes"" then id play the originals or Platinum, i wanted to see how it would look in the actual generation no the same 4 generation but worse... I need more info but so far im disappointed",Can you play them on the switch?,pokemon
Remakes look awful and the hype has been absolutely drained from my body. How did they manage to fuck up something literally everyone wanted?,You didn’t want roblox: a d/p mini game adventure?,pokemon
"Masuda's co-directing BDSP.

Pack it in guys, that shit is going to be dead on arrival.",He directed the originals too though?,pokemon
"I'm going to keep it real. BDSP looks hideous, and  Legends Arceus looks just OK.",Typical Pokémon fan in this sub it’s all complaining always,pokemon
"coming in to work late because of this🤣🤣 it starts at the top of the hour right?

Edit: y’all see the leaks? I’m hype AF",Unless it's like Tesla presentations where they're 45 mins late.,pokemon
"Legends is open world, and Gen 9 will likely follow this same pattern. It seems to be a test run. Amazing. And honestly I haven’t played Pearl or Diamond since 2005 when it was released so I am thrilled with the faithful remake that has updated graphics. 

Happy that Game Freak is finally listening to their fans",I think these new 3d graphics look worse than the 2007 pixel art. I mean I swear I've seen those player models on Roblox before.,pokemon
"Legends looks cool but that framerate tho. I'm interested in the lore too, like how Sinnoh got Rowlet. If you can find Piplup in the wild a long time ago, does that make the starters endangered species that survive only in captivity?

Snap looks great.

Diamond and Pearl remakes look neat - glad to see that they're using another developer. The graphics are kind of iffy, they kind of bring to mind ORAS and Let's Go. I like the chibi style but I feel like SW/SH's could've been better.",The direct said that the starters were brought there by a professor who had collected them in other regions.,pokemon
"If the remakes are just ORAS for Sinnoh then, that'll be good -- but if it's legitimately just ""HD Rerelease of D & P, it's just the same game in HD"" that'll be a pretty disappointing use of perfectly good outsourcing, and I don't know if anyone wanted that.

I hope there is no Dexit. If it's ""hey you can only use Sinnoh pokémon and a couple handful of others lol"" it'll be absolutely awful and I don't think anyone will be happy. I'm not even expecting new Megas or Z-Moves or anything -- I'll be overjoyed if they add those, but I'm not expecting them -- Gigantamax can die though.

If there's Dexit, after using the same Devs as Pokémon Home to make the games, that'll be like a poetic amount of bad decision making. ""Hey guys remember that software you spent a bunch of time developing? Well it's not going to get used again cause we're making sure that most people have to just leave their pokémon in there untouched due to yet another Dexit with the D&P remakes lol""

I'm hoping that because this is outsourced, and it's a small studio (to my knowledge) who have been handed a very big, very sought after (for years now) project, that they'll really put a lot of effort in and make a fantastic and polished title; but I suppose we'll see on that front. I'm just glad it's not GF making it as lately they seem so bored and dispassionate with the series, and I hope don't live to regret those words.

I would have preferred a newer art style, I don't even have a problem with the actual style itself -- but the actual execution of it looks fucking terrible. The edges are so jaggy and the colours look fuzzy. If it was like ACNH kind of chibi it'd be fine but it looks... aged. Which makes me worry it's not going to be an ORAS -- it's going to just be the same game but in a higher resolution, from graphics to content to gameplay; and I think if that happens then most people, especially the ones who have been begging for remakes for years, are going to be absolutely let down.

[Like look at these screenshots](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/02/sinnoh_confirmed_pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl_officially_announced_for_switch#enlarge-1) the faces of the characters legit look like Figmas, with stickers on their faces. The colours don't pop and all the details kind of just.. blend into each other. And the battle scenes -- looking at the pants on the player character, they literally just look like drawn pants filled in with a grey fill tool. I think the chibi style was a huge misstep, I know they were aiming to ""hark back to what D&P graphics looked like"" but this isn't in 2D now, it's in 3D. The remake art style reminds me of those Minecraft ""HD REALISTIC TEXTURE PACKS"" that there are too many of, and 90% of them look derivative and awful.","> I don't know if anyone wanted that.


Basically everyone wanted that.",pokemon
"Anyone else getting a _Link’s Awakening_ vibe from the BDSP overworld components? Not that I’m complaining; it’s cute. Also, thank goodness for no _Let’s Go_ mechanics; looks like we’re keeping the regular style. 

_Legends Arceus_ looks pretty dope. Maybe one step closer to the BotW-style open world we’ve been hoping for?",I had the impression it looks like a worse version of Links Awakening so yeah...,pokemon
Everyone on here hating the art style for the D&P remakes while I’m just hoping for more than two fire types in the sinnohdex 😔,We get 0 fire types this time. Good luck.,pokemon
"Calling it now: Pokemon Legends is set in 'past' Sinnoh so the developers don't have to populate the world with tons of buildings or objects.

I hope I'm wrong, but calling a very empty world.

Remind me 1 year.","I mean there's no need for a reminder, it's obvious with how the SWSH DLC's came out. I just hope this will be an early stage build up for what the future Pokemon games could look like.",pokemon
Legends looks good but holy f*ck the graphics are awful. The map looks sooo empty.,I think it’s a proof of concept still. Looks super laggy and empty right now.,pokemon
"I know I’m not saying anything new with this, but I’m somewhat surprised/disappointed with the footage so far of Brilliant Diamond. I feel like Gamefreak knows by now they have an older audience with this game who’s looking for something with maybe just a little expanded gameplay. The art style says it’s geared towards a 4 year old. Game companies very well know that visual language conveys 99% of the message.

Maybe it’s just footage of something that has yet to be developed and fleshed-out, but it looks very lukewarm in comparison to Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. This is considering that DP is the highest-selling pokemon game in recent times and now has a mostly grown and faithful audience. 

Im afraid this looks like just a quick cash-grab on GameFreak’s end, as they’re even outsourcing the development with this one.","I don’t think Gamefreaks alone is to blame. That decision was probably made by the Pokemon company (including nintendo and creatures inc), but I completely agree with you",pokemon
"Can I just ask one thing?
HOW ARE YALL STILL COMPLAINING",Chibi remake art style looks like roblox. I didn’t see anyone requesting this.,pokemon
"I’m prepared to take on angry comments for this but,

After pointing out numerous amounts of things wrong with the previous Pokémon games, how is it so many people are still sitting here praising this? I don’t believe anything has changed whatsoever and this is just an attempt to give people what they want to put a bandaid over what was sword and shield. There is only cheap hype in the pokemon community and a majority of it will eat up anything thrown their way. I don’t trust any of this as of this point.","This is what's getting me too. I remember this sub HATED and to this day still hates SwSh graphics. I honestly stopped coming into the sub because it was just filled with really nasty and extreme hatred.

To then find these same people praising the chibi style? Bruh we've gone back like 3 generations in graphics. And it doesn't even look like the remakes have any updates at all. No map changes, area retouches, no sign of Platinum stuff. And it's getting so much love. I'm getting whiplash.

People seem more pissed about the names like wut lmao",pokemon
"I hate it... they made a 1:1 3d carbon copy of the original game

its not really a remake, its akin to a remaster....

it hurts",Lol,pokemon
Lol the remakes have literally the same art style as the originals and you still complain this sub is the best 😂,"Same art style? What are you smoking. The originals had beautiful pixel art, and imo are the best looking games in the series (I prefer 2d over 3d).

The art style made sense for the originals because it was a top down handheld game selling for 40$ in 2006. These are AAA  main series games, on Nintendo's most powerful CONSOLE selling for 60$ in 2021.

You know what other game had a chibi art style? The original RSE. The remakes looked gorgeous at the time and were modernised in a way most people considered perfect (except the battle frontier). They were made in the same style as the generation they were in.

It's pretty hard to fault people when you have 15 years of precedence of doing something and they MAJORLY underdeliver. That's like your washing machine randomly breaking after 15 years of perfect use.",pokemon
"So they're outsourcing the remakes and they have this really ""unique?"" Style.... Not living for it",... it's the same style as the originals,pokemon
"Honestly though, the chibi look is pretty meh...[Just look at how he runs, it's like an old final fantasy game](https://youtu.be/maIfkfLgqrk?t=52) and Legends: Arceus was running at like 15 fps for most of it. Not sure how many others noticed as well but all the [wild pokemon were limited to 5 or less fps...Just look at chimecho](https://youtu.be/McJN_is_ADY?t=71) It looked so weird. The main problem i have with the D/P remakes is that it doesn't look like enough of an improvement to warrant someone forking out $50 for unless they don't own the original.

I'm still baffled how they can't make the game look/run even remotely like BoTW.

Regardless I cant wait to give it a go and hopefully they receive improvements over the next year or so!","I mean, BotW doesn’t exactly run and peak FPS but yeah, definitely looked choppy in places",pokemon
"Game Freak are really just phoning it in now with the mainline series huh

like they showed three games and the highly-requested and long-anticipated GEN 4 REMAKES looked like they had the least effort put into them out of everything (hell, they outsourced them to another goddamn company)

meanwhile the spin-offs had better graphics AND more interesting looking gameplay (people have been clamouring for a real open-world pokemon game for years and they finally do it... in a spin-off)",If they did those changes to mainline/remake games people here would still be complaining so,pokemon
I actually hate the art style. I feel like I’m looking at a Disney Junior TV show.,XD. its not great.,pokemon
"Why am I not surprised by getting disappointed?

DPP had been easily the most hyped remake and fans gets a copy paste + a few retouch of the old game","Nah, I think ORAS were the most hyped remakes and they absolutely delivered on those. Sinnoh... I’m upset that they randomly decided that now is the time to worry about faithfulness to the originals instead of updating them to modern standards...",pokemon
"This direct has shown me that some of you aren't even Pokémon fans anymore. 99% of this place has been begging for Sinnoh games. So today we got them. So you complain about the art style, the most minor thing about a game, but fine. You don't like the cartoony art style, here's a Sinnoh game that looks more in line with major RPG and open world games. But you don't like that either? It's literally what you just said you wanted from Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. And you still don't like it. 

At this point you just have to accept that you don't like Pokémon. No matter what they do.","“No matter what they do”

This is blatantly false.",pokemon
"Y'all literally cannot be pleased holy shit lol. Just quit playing pokemon at this point damn

So fucking pumped for Gen 4 remakes and that they did an updated version of the top-down style.","i’m a little confused about the gen 4 remakes. are they bringing anything new to the table? like how ORAS were part of gen 6 so had megas? like i get having “faithful remakes” for fire red, leaf green, heart gold, and soul silver since those were from the gameboy age, but if all BDSP have to offer are graphical improvements i don’t really feel like it’s gonna be worth $60. for all the hate SwSh get, at least they were something new.",pokemon
That remake looks like a 3ds game,Had moments of N64 in my opinion.,pokemon
"Underwhelming and unprofessional presentation ✓

Mediocre graphics, ugly art styles, and low frame rates ✓

Sixty dollars BTW ✓

I am happy for you, less critical fans, I am sure you are hyped. I wish I could be too.",Yup.  I'm happy.  The world is a whole lot brighter when you're optimistic.,pokemon
"What the hell, D&P look freaking terrible. What a joke of a company.","Its not terrible per se. I like the color schemes of it all in all is true to the original.

However, the tiny characters just remind me too much of old school Bomberman on N64",pokemon
"The remakes look awful, but Legends actually looks promising. This is what Sword and Shield should have been.",Totally agree with you.,pokemon
"I'm sure the Legends graphics and performance will get better guys, remember when people pointed out framerate drops and draw distance issues in Sword and Shield's Wild Area and it came out completely 100% fine???","I still have framerate issues in the wild area, soooo",pokemon
I can't think of a reason anybody should play these remakes over the originals. They look and run exactly the same. It's a 15 year old game repackaged as something new.,Especially true if they price them at 60$,pokemon
"First words out of my mouth when the D/P remake trailer started was ""OH MY GOD YES""

Second words were ""wait is this a 3DS remake?""

GameFreak your games have the visual aesthetic of dogshit.",It ain't gamefreak so you can't blame them.  You guys asked for this.,pokemon
Pokémon fans finally got both of the major things we had been asking for and they’re STILL COMPLAINING. Typical. Stop shitting on people who like the dp remakes,That's like saying. Man I really want a sandwich and then someone gives gives a shit sandwich hehe u got wat u wanted y r u complainin?,pokemon
Shit I’d rather just start a new play through of platinum tbh. Those DP remakes look hideous,"Honestly, the fact that the game will hopefully run faster than DPPt is enough to sell me",pokemon
"I personally like the art style for the remakes, it reminds me of links awakening",Yeah and it is perfect for nostalgia as well because it let's everything still look basically the same,pokemon
"People wanted their DP remakes, and are mad they’re getting exactly what they asked for? They were never gonna reinvent the wheel here? That said, I don’t really care for it. I’ve played them before, so I’m less interested in reliving that experience in HD.

Legends, of course, looks to be a test in taking Pokémon in the sort of BotW/open world direction people have been clamoring for for what seems like forever.

Footage and UI is clearly proof of concept, but it’s without a doubt the Pokémon game with the greatest amount of potential in over a decade.","I mean, D&P look like Chinese knockoffs.",pokemon
"Everybody: Loves Sinnoh

Remakes :Are gonna be faithful

Everybody: Loses their shit",Remakes aren’t supposed to look worse than the originals...,pokemon
"Hot take: the chibi-esque art style for the DP remakes is *way* better than the style of the recent games. 

Y'all are crazy if you think the switch to anime style 3D in X and Y did these games any favors.","That is a hot take. I think both are ugly, and I’d love a game that’s actually 3D and knows how to use it OR a return to 2D.",pokemon
"I waited for years for a Gen 4 remake and now they're here I just...feel nothing. It's really depressing, I should be freaking the fuck out right now, but...yeah, nothing.",Looks like a mobile game.,pokemon
"Key takeaways:

\- DP remakes NOT developed by Game Freak! Hallelujah! I'll buy them, because we're finally getting something new from Game Freak.

\- I like the chibi art style. It's something different and surprisingly faithful to the original sprites. The visuals are otherwise a bit boring, but hey, they're remakes of a DS game. They look OK all things considered.

\- Cautiously optimistic about Pokemon Legends. The biggest problem is that it's being developed by Game Freak, and it's coming out early next year. That means they didn't have much time to work on it. Animations still look bad, the visuals aren't significantly better than SwSh, and we don't know much about it. Not sure I'll be buying it yet.",Not mainline so it seems they have the luxury of delaying it,pokemon
"People already found something to complain about with both announcements jfc guys

Here I was thinking this sub wouldn’t be a toxic mess when the news we all wanted was released","> Here I was thinking this sub wouldn’t be a toxic mess

The first mistake",pokemon
"The remake style is fucking disgusting, like a cheap chinese mobile game.

The open world has potential but holy fuck it looked empty (from what I could see from the 4 frames we got).

Being a pokemon fan is so hard dude.",NO! cheap chinese mobile games have been looking much better since 2011,pokemon
"ok im going to be real

how do the non-mainline graphic pokemon games look way better than the highly requested gen 4 remakes

ughghghg","I would put crazy money on Legends: Arceus being the mainline title. It's probably the new route GameFreak wants to go. 

BDSP is everything I wanted from the next true Pokemon games, with the sole exception that I wanted a return to pixelart for the artstyle. But Chibi is fine with me, the game environments look perfect.",pokemon
This is garbage for 25th anniversary. Nintendo is laughing at everyone and people are buying the hell out of it,"They've realized that 25 is just a number. They will use it to promote hashtags and build hype, but clearly they've concluded that special releases aren't worth it. A bummer, but I guess it's reality.",pokemon
The constant buffering is really embarrassing.,Think thats on YouTubes end honestly.,pokemon
The youtube description under the video for some reason marks it as being connected to Sun and Moon specifically.... Pokemon Ultra Ultra Sun and Ultra Ultra Moon to be announced?,Nah YouTube does this kinda stuff all the time,pokemon
God yes this is exactly what I wanted. I was never a huge fan of the transition from 2D to 3D in terms of camera and perspective so I'm excited to see a return to the original style that I thought we'd lost.,"Same, everybody is tripping saying it’s terrible but I think it’s perfect",pokemon
Wish they would just port the 2D games over.,Yeah if they released like a megapack of the originals would get them.,pokemon
I actually cried when I saw the Sinnoh remakes I’m so happy!,I cried too... The reason though was probably not the same.,pokemon
"I'm excited for both games they announced, but graphically I'm not a fan of either.",Not even legends?,pokemon
"I thought it might never happen again, but I am so very hyped for mainline Pokémon again. Both the DP remakes and Legends, I am so very excited. Graphics-wise, both are well beyond superior to SwSh. Gameplay-wise, Legends is the console Pokémon adventure I always dreamed of as a young kid.

I’ve said that if they improved the graphics and gameplay I would be fine with no National Dex, with no expectation that it would happen. Then it did!",I’m perfectly fine with how the DP remakes are if that means the next gen is better because it does seem they did this to cushion room for themselves and I’m all for,pokemon
"Omg the Gen 4 remakes look like the Zelda Links Awakening remake AMD I LOVE IT

I LOVE IT ALL",That's exactly what I thought. It looks like a combo from original DP graphics and links awakening,pokemon
"I can't believe how unbelievably lazy the Diamond and Pearl remakes are. They kept the exact same layout and camera angle so they could just copy and paste everything from the originals. That would have been bad enough on it's own, but the actual visuals are awful. Link's Awakening showed us what this game could look like, and yet the visuals here look so spectacularly bland.

Aside from resolution, I'd argue that X and Y look better.

Gamefreak have already been under a lot of criticism for being lazy/cheap when it comes to putting any effort into the games, and now they've just decided to outsource to another studio. Except they didn't even bother to outsource it to a big name who could do it justice. They went with some obscure one that developed a Pokemon app.

I couldn't care less about Pokemon Legends at the moment. I suppose a lot could change before release, but right now nothing about it excited me. The world looked barren, and the visuals looked low effort again. And that framerate of the Pokemon  was absolutely laughable. I can't believe they thought that would be acceptable to put into a trailer.

New Pokemon Snap looks excellent though. It's basically a prettied up Pokemon Snap 1, which is all I wanted. I'm glad they didn't try to reinvent the wheel with it.","I've mentioned elsewhere that I'm honestly a little intrigued by Pokemon Legends, but I couldn't agree more on everything else. It's kinda insulting that after so many years, *this* is the remake gen 4 is getting. We know they can do so much better, and the fact the game looks worse than one that came out eight years ago for a *handheld console* has me flabbergasted. They really just don't care; they're just shoveling out whatever they can with the least amount of effort and money spent, banking on the fact that people will just buy it because Pokemon.

I've got a lot of nostalgia for gen 4 (Wasn't my first pokemon game, but I sunk a LOT of time into it as a kid and it was easily my favorite up until X and Y), so this honestly stings extra bad for me. I've been wanting this remake for so long, and seeing how half-assed it is makes me so sad for the franchise I used to love so much growing up.",pokemon
The fact that Pokemon Legends is not split into two titles is way more massive and people are completely ignoring that. Sword and Shield might be the last generation to be split into two versions.,Thats not the main game.... Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl,pokemon
I don't really understand why they're putting out an ugly remake of DP while also putting out Arceus Legends. Like what's the point of the DP remakes when Legends looks far more interesting?,"Easy money, that's the point",pokemon
"I am excited for what is clearly a new game for the Gameboy color in the legend of arceus

Nice of Nintendo to revisit old devices","lmao same. Real talk though, what a disappointing reveal.",pokemon
ARKeus? Thought it was ARSEus,"That's the japanese name, you can see the problem with that pronounciation though, so it was changed.",pokemon
"No matter how you feel about todays game reveals, Let’s be grateful we didn’t get Let’s go Jhoto. That really was a possibility",someone else was talking about they were really hoping for Let's Go Johto,pokemon
"So am I the only one who thought the starter shot for Legends: Arceus was weird?  It looked way out of place given the era of the other areas of the game.  Looked like the Oval Office, honestly.",Yeah I think that part must take place in modern day or something.,pokemon
"OK, but seriously, what the fuck was that intro?",I loved it,pokemon
[deleted],"Most people would look at that trailer, see a large open world. And make the right assumption",pokemon
Why couldn't the remakes look as good as Sword and Shield.. Or even better?,because they hate gen 4 and put minimal effort into it,pokemon
"I LIKE how the remakes look. People on twitter are bitching about them, but they remind me of Cave Story. I'm super excited.",[deleted],pokemon
"I’m so emotional rn. Sinnoh was my first region and it’s so amazing that they’re pulling open world using it, as long as remaking the games",Open world where it's all wilderness,pokemon
The remake visuals look... “cheap”? If that makes sense. It sorta loses the charm of the original. Also damn are the logos horrendous,there are 45554 better fanmade logos already made throughout the years and they refused to give up MS paint smh,pokemon
"Ive never seen a more blatantly obvious and lazy cashgrab in my life.  I’m very disappointed with what the Pokémon company has been considering good enough to put out now.  I want to like the concept for the Arceus game but unfortunately I just can’t, the framerate and rendering is abysmal and this is the reveal trailer.  If they couldn’t fix that for it’s literal first appearance, I doubt it will be much better in the main game, just look at how buggy the wild area was.  I will have to skip buying any Pokémon game from hear on out until they get their stuff together and actually give us the effort that they once did, because right now they aren’t.","arcues game has potential- but also has potential to be super bad imo. you can't just slap a botw skin on something and expect it to be good. framerate definitely needs to be fixed, they have a year so let's see.

i do agree though they shouldn't have shown a trailer where the framerate was so poor, shoulda been pushed back but i guess they needed to present it for the 25th anniverssary. if the final game is like that I probably wont get it",pokemon
I really don't like the remake's style,They just remind if of the Miis from the Wii.,pokemon
Pokémon bdsp looks terrible I hope they make a option to have original graphics,hahaha if I could use the original graphics maybe I'd consider playing this game... Because these graphics are sooo bad that hurts.,pokemon
">layout of the map is identical to the original games

Good, don't innovate, please GF. Clearly you failed with Sword and Shield so I don't want you to fuck up more remakes. At least now I'll know what to expect.  Just do remakes and have the same layouts from now on, no improvement, nothing. Just regression but in 3D with better graphics.

That Arceus game literally looks like Sword and Shield. How about you walk closer to that tree and then we'll talk.","honestly though if there's no innovation i'm just gonna play the originals lol

especially if they don't add anything from platinum, it'll suffer from the same issues as the original (no fire types, etc)",pokemon
[deleted],"hahahah, you're funny man.",pokemon
So is anyone really excited for pokemon unite? I can't get behind it but if there is people who likes it then I'm glad you got what you wanted,"I didn't even know what it was, just saw it, So basically LoL, but it's pokemon. Seems cool yeah",pokemon
Is this an announcement?,"No, just a nostalgia/history reel right now.",pokemon
Are these gonna be compatible with the main series games?,"I hope not, let’s just let them rot",pokemon
The remakes visuals are going to be a hot topic. I'm not personally a huge fan (will still be getting) but I do think they are similar to how DP looked. I get where it's coming from.,Why would you still get it? It’s a DP remake and not Platinum or have the Plat dex. I’d recommend just replaying that as it’s definitely better than this,pokemon
Oh boy “faithful remakes” there goes the battle frontier.,Imagine if they keep the surf speed from DP,pokemon
No word of Dexit for the BDSP (is that what we're going for?) Remakes was there,"They said everything from DP would be in. Whether that means 493, or 210, or 151 (plus a few extras) is unclear.

But there *is* a Dexit. We can be mostly sure of that.",pokemon
Any news on dex size for BD and SP?,"Yeah my uncle works at gamefreak and... oh wait, it's not gamefreak anymore",pokemon

So there’s no word on megas vs. giga max???,"Slow down there, champ, we can only get so many gimmicks crammed into each game",pokemon
But can we transfer our old pokes into any of these games or are they all still stuck in ~~purgatory~~ Pokémon Home?,"I kinda regret transferring ALL of my Pokemon into Home. I did have a bunch of mythical events queued up in the Pokemon Centers though that I waited to pick up and left most of them in 6th/7th gen and still will probably leave them there, especially the ones that can't be moved into Sword/Shield.",pokemon
Is that really how Arceus is said? I always thought it was with a soft C (s sound),They changed it so it wouldn't sound like a bad word lol,pokemon
"I think competitive/VGC is becoming a bigger lure into the pokemon franchise. Catching them all is still a lure for me too, but less so. I think I need to feel some sort of complexity or strategic component - an itch I doubt Legends will scratch. D/P remakes will be nice, since at least there will be some online component and original mechanics, but I can't help but wonder if they won't be enough to sustain VGC/competitive pokemon (unless the remakes allow all previous mons to be transferred into it... doubtful). Maybe important to note that I'm more of a spectator, for competitive, but at this point in my life I'd probably only purchase another pokemon game if there are compelling competitive features. Is Nintendo moving away from this?

there was an ice type rhydon in the legends trailer?,"Yeah I saw that, can't work out if it's just wonky beta lighting but only that one pokemon was the wrong colour",pokemon
So is Pokemon Legends going to be considered a spin-off or a main series game for Pokemon like the natural successor of Sword/Shield?,"I wouldn't call it a successor to SwSh since apparently there will be no new Pokémon and moves introduced, but I also wouldn't call it a spin-off. So maybe, a prequel kind of main series thing?",pokemon
"I really wanted the Virtual Console games. 25 years of Pokémon games on one console. Right now emulators are the only way to get this, but it’s not really legit. With remakes from another studio it doesn’t look like this will happen anytime soon.

I really want it to get a complete Pokédex with hidden abilities from their original game. Virtual consoles are an incredibly easy way to get hidden abilities. I’m done with gen 1, gen 2, gen 5, gen 6, gen 7 and gen 8. 
With gen 3 and 4 hidden abilities isn’t available. The only way is ability patches in Crown Tundra, and that’s too time consuming. 

Well I’m also hoping for a way to catch all the mythical Pokémon. It looks like they are slowly letting us do this. Deoxys in ORAS, Celebi in Virtual Console, Keldeo in Crown Tundra, and a few in Pokémon Go max raid battles (better than nothing. Need gift Pokémon to transfer and use in game though).

Really happy with the early 2022 game at least. Hope they spend time developing a passable story this time. Kids can handle better, more adult stories. That’s when you remember them as an adult. Who will remember the story from Sword and Shield? Nobody.","SUPPOSEDLY there's a rumor saw that in april/may there's going to be a nintendo online revamp along with adding VC stuff; who knows if it will turn out to be real or if pokemon would even be added, but that's better than a 0% chance :)",pokemon

Sooo what was that statue from that town in Sinnoh? A fusion? Seriously what was that,The original 2D sprite was meant to look like both Dialga and Palkia depending on how you looked at it. You can't really pull off that effect with a 3D model. A fusion of the two was probably the closest they could get in 3D,pokemon

"Okay so Im wondering who the starters represent. My wife figures Rowlett is ninjas, I think Oshawatt is samurais, is Cyndaquil just a bomb maker?","I believe cyndaquil is fire magic. That would make rowlett archery, and oshawott swordsmanship.",pokemon

"Every time there's a Pokémon announcement, I get confused, and I've had enough: which is the correct pronunciation, PO-kuh-MON, or po-KAY-mon? Nintendo always use the latter anymore, but I grew up saying the former.

Do you guys think we will get the national dex for the remakes or maybe Legends Arceus? Im really not sure,"National Dex for either is unlikely. 

For BDSP, it seems like they will remain as faithful as possible, and that might suggest not adding many Pokemon past Gen 4.

Legends cannot have all the Pokemon, unless GameFreak broke their own lore and such. Porygon, for example, was made from programmers or scientists or whatever, so it would not make sense for it to be present.",pokemon

"There's a bunch if things to be excited and disappointed from all these announcements, but one thing I can't look over are the title names for the remakes. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl; really GameFreak? I literally remember reading comments here saying how the fan made titles are too over-the-top or have no real connection to the cover box legendaries. Are you guys going to tell me now that Temporal Diamond and Celestial Pearl are worse than what we got?","Like it or not, Pokemon has always been marketed for kids.

Happy about outsourced remakes and the return of chibi. Is it me or did they bring back the underground? Looking good so far. Hopefully they finally abolish Galar border patrol,Definitely saw what looked like the underground. No ui but the player walking through it,pokemon
"Ok, one small problem with Pokémon Legends currently. So they’re presenting Sinnoh as this untouched land full of wild Pokémon. Whereas the region Sinnoh was based on, Hokkaido, already had people. 

The Ainu already lived there so I’m kinda conflicted with getting excited for this new game and worried that it’s going to a bit of once removed settler revisionism.",Just wait til you learn hokkaido never actually had pokemon,pokemon
Question is will these chibi remakes cost $60? I’m sure they will because they know people will buy Gen 4.,¥ou b€t your a$$ th€¥ wi££.,pokemon
Pokemon Legends Arceus is bascially Breath of the Wild with Pokemon and I'm going to cry. I've wanted this since I played BOTW!! And I've wanted an open world game for even longer. As much as I love Diamond and Pearl I'm honestly looking forward to this even more than the remakes.,it looks more like Pokemon Wild Area: The Game. Run around and do nothing,pokemon
"I'm not hopeful, call me a pessimist but that chimchar moving at 2 FPS, and the whole game looking like they tried to make breath of the wild for the PS2. And the sinnoh remakes seem like they're the exact same games but they made dawn cooking mama. But at least we get to live in a region named after a bean and take photos.","With the release in 2022, I’m still optimistic about it. I love the idea and I’m hoping that it comes together well.",pokemon
You guys think legends arceus would have a competitive format? I’m super duper interested in it. Like its basically a new game. I wonder what online looks like. But ngl would still play it even if it doesnt have online,Don't expect much more than what you've already seen,pokemon
"This might be a hot take but both games looked so incredibly lazy to me. The new art style for sinnoh is chibi but not even done well, like it looks cheap. Compare that to something like links awakening which looks way better imo. Even arceus, the modelling and animations were horrible, its still in development of course but all we can go off is the footage they chose to show us, and what they showed us was choppy animation, cheap models, and rough framerate. Especially coming after Sw/Sh, I would wait on pre ordering",snap 2 kinda looks good tho at least,pokemon
"The 25 years montage was a decent trip through memory lane, but HOW DARE THEY skip out on the single greatest spin of franchise of all time. Where was Pokepark??","I think there was a little scene of the sprinting minigame in there.

But they skipped ma boi Pokemon XD",pokemon

"The remakes don’t interest me at all.  

Arceus does, at least for now.  If they put exp share or something then it will kill my interest completely",i can guarantee that they will have exp share. hopefully they will allow you to toggle it on and off though.,pokemon
"The Sinnoh Remake looks like someone saw Link's Awakening and went ""Yeah, we can do that, exactly like that""

looks like it was released on the 3ds",It looks worse than the sprite DP. It doesn’t even merit new titles as it clearly doesn’t introduce ANYTHING new. ORAS on the 3DS spits on this title. And you know they’ll charge more for this than ORAS too,pokemon
So like this new Pokemon game looks like the wilds empty. Like Breath of the Wild was a release title for the switch and it had more detail than this. Like compare it to the new Monster Hunter game it's so underwhelming.,True but it still has a year of development to go. It said it’s all early gameplay and subject to change,pokemon
"How shit do the remakes look

but how fucking good does that legends look",I'm glad that the Pokemon have more contrast instead of the washed out looks of recent games.,pokemon
"Hopefully those gen 4 remakes aren’t full price. They’re cute but just seem like simple remakes.

No Pokemon unite news has me a bit bummed",It will hurt being asked to pay $80cdn for a 3DS/Mobile looking remake.,pokemon
"The Diamond and Pearl remakes better have every pokemon, there is absolutely no excuses this time and is the only way they can be redeemed.",or at least every one remaining. BDSP + SwSh = full dex,pokemon
Literally nothing will be announced today. Don’t be excited. I’m so cynical and interesting. Look at how ReAlIsTiC I am. /s,I am thinking there will be at least one pokemon shown in this pokemon presents. Hope my expectations aren't too high.,pokemon
"Well, you got what you wanted? Happy now? I don't understand people. Everyone complained about SwSh's graphics, so now they went back to something reminiscent to the old graphics, and we still complain! And I bet people will still complain about the Arceus game looking like SwSh. What does the community want? BoTW or Odyssey type graphics? Please explain this hypocrisy.",because the remake looks far worse than the original sprite work...,pokemon
Well that sucked,how,pokemon
I like the non sword and shield graphics for the remake because I just want them to spend time on the games and not try and make backgrounds you can’t explore and n64 trees,Agreed. Since when was it the graphics that made Pokemon games special anyway?,pokemon
"To everyone thinking Legends will be on Breath of the Wild's scale.... just stop. This spin-off Pokemon game is being developed in 2 years by Gamefreak's small team. This is going to be Let's Go with a pretty background, and that's if we're lucky.","I agree it's not going to be on the scale of BotW, but ""Let's Go with a pretty background""? Really? It doesn't really seem like Let's Go at all, minus the ""throw Pokeballs"" part, but even that is still different from Let's Go.",pokemon
"OKAY SO

1.) Pokemon New Snap - Cool. If its not as pathetically short as the original, it seems good. May get it.

2.) D/P remakes - Pokemon has a TERRIBLE track record with remakes imo. They have yet to make a SINGLE good remake, so i have my doubts, but THANKFULLY GF has nothing much to do with this. Im....cautiously optomistic.

3.) Legends - It MAY be the stream but holy fuck is this game bad. Runs terribly, looks ugly as hell, etc. Hope this is NOT the direction the games go. Partially because this is a terrible first impression and partially because i personally hate open world style games like this.","I'm sorry but how have any of their remakes been anything but stellar?

And then we look at Arceus, a prequel to Sinnoh, I know it's still in development but it looks laggy, unfinished, and grainy. If that's the best they can show us in a non-gameplay trailer, I think we're in trouble.

"Hey I really enjoyed Pokemon X and Pokemon Omega Ruby, will I like the Diamond and Pearl remakes? I did not enjoy Pokemon Moon.",yes for sure. It won’t be like moon at all. The sinnoh region is great with its mountains and forrests and it seems like they’ve copied it tile for tile,pokemon
Why the fuck are 2 diffrent versions of the same game still a thing? If im paying full price for a game I would prefer to have all the content.

"From a game design POV the Remakes will probably be no different from the originals, but hopefully they won’t water it down as they did with hoenn. Also, visually speaking it looks pretty unpolished, especially the overword models, but i do have high hopes for it. As for pokemon legends... it has the chance to be absolutely AMAZING or absolute trash, but i like that they’re finally giving arceus something ever since that Azure flute fiasco","Yea I liked the art style, it reminded me of the new Links Awakening art but definitely didn't look as polished. My only change i hope they make it replacing the HM dependency. Having to constantly change up my team/carry pokemon I didn't want to definitely slowed the pace way down. I'm hoping instead of having to use say Fog, there's like an NPC with a torch or some shit that helps you through. Idk anything that will replace HM slaves will be nice. I still hope they keep the unique weather effects, just use a better option to traverse them.",pokemon
"Super stoked at Sinnoh remakes.

For BD/SP it looks like the graphics from Let's Go, kind of. What do you all think? I really like the sprites of the 3DS version (as an old man, and retro gamer...lol). Anyway I hope it's a good remake. Will the mechanics be like Let's Go ?

Legends Arceus looks bad-ass! 👌",Lol no it looks like roblox. I’m not impressed at this remake. Looks like a mini game.,pokemon

This isn't me bashing either, just an observation after all the shit the purists give Let's Go.","I don't think the issue was ever the let's go catching mechanic itself.

Up on Melancholy Hill There's a Plastic Tree,Are you here with me?,pokemon
You have become one with galar and the uk,But I’m drinking Chinese herbal tea though ....lol,pokemon
Can you invite me to the next Pokemon tea party?,"Sure will, at Glenwood Tangle it will be!!!",pokemon
Where did you get those!?!?!?!,It was from pokemon center japan preorder a few months ago.,pokemon
I need them,None of them are hot... Where's the honey?,pokemon
One of the cutest Pokémon. I named mine Boolong Tea.,That's a cute name,pokemon
"wait, but did you see if it was an authentic Polteageist?  🤔",There is only pokemon cafe logo underneath...they miss the opportunity to make this inside joke 😅,pokemon
The designs on those are so clever!,I have a feeling they designed these two Pokémon with a plan to make them into merch haha,pokemon
didn't even se the snorlax plate at first,You must have been sleepy just like snorlax :P,pokemon
Does this break rule 3c? It's just a compilation if products.,"Could argue people's pokemon collection posts fit under the same...bit we don't, because we aren't Sri k in the muds. :)",pokemon
I really dig that artstyle. It's like Gen 6 but better.,Thank you so much!!,pokemon
Wait wait wait are you the same artist who did all of the pop stars as pokemon trainers!?!? The art style seems so similar,"Yes, it's been me all along! (Ba dumm tsss) 💖🧹",pokemon
"I love this!

Also I'll be able to watch the finale in about half an hour. I'm excited! (WandaVision not Pokémon)

Also I know it's Wanda's colour scheme/outfit but the red is making me think she's team flare. (Im currently playing gen6 if you couldn't tell)","Hahaha she would totally fit Team Flare! Enjoy the episode, it was awesome :)",pokemon
"Did you makes this? You should do more, like vision or something",Yeah! I did one with Vision behind Wanda too hahaha you can check on my insta brex\_art,pokemon
OP this is great! You should crosspost this to r/wandavision !,Will do! Thanks for the idea! :D,pokemon
That’s a way better shiny than Meowstic’s actual shiny tbh,Since Wanda has the power to create a whole new reality why not a new Meowstic color pattern? 🤭,pokemon
"Beautiful! And I love the touch of Gengar being her hat!

Not that this isn’t absolutely perfect, but I always pictured Pietro using Latios and Wanda using Latias. Because of the being twins and color scheme thing.",That's a great idea! Poor pietro :(,pokemon
"I love those Meowstics, they are one of my favourites from gen6, I love cats",Love them too!!,pokemon
Meowstic is my favorite pokemon. That red ones you drew are so cute! I didn't know anybody else even knew what meowstic is.,Thank you! My sister loves Meowstics because she's a crazy cat lady so I always have them in mind when thinking of Cat Pokémon hahah,pokemon
Is wandavision good TV? Outside of the context of it being marvel content.,Yes it's awesome! One of the best TV shows this year for sure!,pokemon
cant she just rewind time if she loses?,Don't let her know!!,pokemon
Those look good! Especially loving Groudon.,Thank you 😊,pokemon
"I love your style and alternative perspective.

What's going on with Groudon's right hand? (Seen on the left) It appears anemic compared to the other.","Thank you. 

Lol. I don't know. Actually , it has been quiet some time since I drew these.",pokemon
How long have you been practicing to draw things in one go? People who use pen are just on a completely different level...,"Drawing has been an inbuilt talent for me. 

For fun , you could just say I was programmed to draw before the release.",pokemon
These are sick,Thank you ❤️,pokemon
Giygogagohwooh!,he is speaking the language of gods,pokemon
I've always thought this about noctowl too like it's normal flying but should by flying psychic it literally puts most foes to sleep with hypnosis the same as stabler it's strange they was not made psychic,Xatu: this town is too small for both of us,pokemon
"I always thought Psyduck should have been called Golduck because of its yellow color, and Golduck should have been called Psyduck because it has much more control of it's psychic ability, and should have gained the psychic typing on evolution. I was hoping for a Mega Golduck with psychic typing, but it never happened",That makes so much sense. And mega golduck would have been awesome!,pokemon
I’ve actually flipped on this matter. I really wish these Pokémon got a hidden ability like Steelworker to give them faux STAB on psychic moves. For two Pokémon that don’t amount to much in most competitive settings and aren’t the best even in the first few generations this gives them a decent buff without leaving them with more weaknesses than they had before. In particular Stantler gets a more interesting interaction with Fighting types while not having to worry more about Bug and Dark.,we need more of that kind of  ability could solve a number of problems,pokemon
I actually thought that both of them were until a year ago. I started playing in 2003 so that's a bit awkward,"I know about Psyduck not being Psychic but somehow I get surprised every time I hear it. It would be so logical if he was, but here we are.",pokemon
"YES PSYDUCK
Also ngl I really hate golduck, my sweet yellow boi was never meant to be 'cool'","I agree, but how’s a blue hairless platypus supposed to be cool though",pokemon
Luxray should be Electric/Dark.,If I remember correctly the word Lux means light so it'd be kinda weird to have a dark type pokemon basically named light ray,pokemon
Blastoise should be steel type.,And Lugia water type,pokemon
Ninetales should've been psychic in gen 1 and fairy in gen 6. It's weird that they only seem to retcon types when new ones are released unless you count the Rotom forme changes because they seem to have realized their mistake with the Alolan form,Ninetales doesn't seem fairy to me but totally psychic.,pokemon
Only golduck applies to me. Stantler is just an ugly deer and Psyduck cant control its powers.,"Stantler is a reindeer bro, we need him for Christmas gimmick teams",pokemon
"What we need is minor typing that works at half effect to get the full flavor of these kinds of Pokémon, maybe have it as a third type?",Half dragon charzard,pokemon
Stantler is a normal deer. That's why girafarig came out in the SAME game and was psychic normal. What planet does it make sense for stantler to be psychic? The only psychic move he even gets off the top of my head is hypnosis and I could be wrong about even that one.,"Hypnosis, calm mind, role play, zen headbutt, imprison",pokemon
"I always get confused about Bonsly being rock, looks like it should be grass at first glance.",That is kinda the whole gimmick behind the Pokémon. Bonsly is a bonsai tree that’s “sly” because it’s actually rock. Sudowoodo is a “pseudo” tree because it’s also made of rock. There was an entire episode of the anime about it. It’s literally the Imitation Pokémon. Most of its Pokédex entries revolve around it’s composition being closer to rock than plant.,pokemon
Could potentially see a small argument for dark or even fairy on stantler but yeah,"Curious. Why those two? From what I can see you’d have to drastically change the move pool since Stantler gets 3 Dark moves, none natively, and 0 Fairy moves. Though I will say it would be nice to have the Fairy type added on to retroactively address the issue that arose from having Stantler and Girafarig introduced in the same region but only having one get a dual typing that made it stand out from early route Pokémon and for the learnset. Could definitely see it with Play Rough as well.",pokemon
"Nope. Just like Galarian Zigzagoon is the ""true"" Zigzagoon, there should be a regional variant of Psyduck that is the ""true"" Water/Psychic Psyduck while the Kanto one is the deficient version that gets headaches.

Stantler needs a Normal/Ice evolution.",why normal/ice?,pokemon
"I now know who the guy behind this meme is, and I respect the meme even more now. Also great use of the meme too!",You respect the meme more because you know a homophobic racist is the man in the picture?,pokemon
Isn't Stantler just a deer?,"technically, reindeer. also, there's lots of pokedex entries mentions its horns and how it can confuse people with them",pokemon
Can someone explain stantler to me?,deer who's antlers are hypnotic,pokemon
* Piano Music Starts *,*gen 5 /ping/ sound*,pokemon
"Man, it’s posts like this that make me regret not playing Gens 3-5 when they came out. I was “too cool” for pokemon then, so I didn’t experience Cynthia, OR this crazy piano house people keep referencing in 5th Gen.

"so tired of the myth that sharks are scary. hollywood has alot to answer for. can they be dangerous: yes, but they're just fish. sharks don't eat people. they evolved long long long before humans ever came around. we taste disgusting to them. we're all done and don't have any meat or fat. most deaths are caused by a single bite that causes blood loss. this is how sharks identify what we are: with their mouths. it's just that humans are weak and tend to die when a large part of us is removed.

That’s a cool shiny Umbreon! Not a bad team at all. This has me thinking about which Pokémon I would want on my all time team.,"I'm a little out of date on pokemon, so I have no idea who is behind lapras, but same here.

Where is the starter pokemon?,"Good question, I mean, it IS an unwritten rule",pokemon
"not the s.s. Anne. it is the s.s. aqua that goes from olivine and vermillion and they would also need to cancel the magnet train and move the league. there is no way they could cut kanto. 

I do stand with the prediction at they would never have ported the Sinnoh frontier. and maybe even the pokeathhlon","Oops, guess its too late the fix that.

In all seriousness Kanto would probably make it in but literally anything else that HG/SS added that the originals lacked would've been omitted nowadays such as the frontier, the pokeathlon and probably even following mons.",pokemon
"I just hope the diamond and pearl remakes don do this to me, i need my battle factory",Don't hold your breath. I made the mistake of assuming that ORAS would have a Battle Frontier and when that didn't happen people told I was dumb to expect to Emerald features in a Ruby & Sapphire remake. I'm just going to stick with my copy of Platinum this time.,pokemon
3 play through a is going to take so much time... great picks.,"Just hope it is worth 3.

And not even bashing it. In the end I replayed swsh 3 times. I kneo crazy to probably many. Granted I do breed my next team and have it all planned out, which is a big part of the fun. Trying out pokemon that were new or I've never gotten to try. This gen finally tried out mamoswine, escadril, tryantar, bisharp and so many. Had a blast. (For me it was focusing on the gym challenge. They did an amazing job there so I had fun and was easy to replay).

But then again have zero clue to truly expect from this game. It's a different genre as well right? So might jjst be a massive long game and doubt I'd be able to replay it. Here's hoping for something amazing!",pokemon
I hope future games give us mixed starter options to use on a new region going forward after Legends comes out. We have plenty of Pokémon to choose from with 8 generations. Love these picks!,I like this idea but also want them to keep innovating with new starters! I’m torn,pokemon
IM SO JAZZED CYNDAQUIL IS AN OPTION!!! (although I really like rowlet's Evo line as well so it will be a tough choice),Cyndaquil is the OG.,pokemon
Im so so happy my boy rowlet is included,"Same here, I love Rowlet and his evolutions",pokemon
Are these actual figures,"Sadly not
They appear to be just 3D renders but would make great figures",pokemon
Anyone else seriously considering Rowlet? Normally not a grass starter kind of person but exploring an open world with a Decidueye would be so cool,"I love Rowlet and his line! They’re pretty much the only grass starters I actually like. But I love cyndaquil and his line, too. Such a tough decision!",pokemon
"part of me was sad about these picks because Piplup is my favorite starter out of all the starters of every gen but I'd be lying if I said Oshawott isn't very adorable as well, and I can just catch a Piplup if I want one anyway","I agree, I love the way pull-up looks so much, I used to prevent her from evolving",pokemon
Typhlosion is arguably the best fire starter because of the move options it gets,"If you’re going by competitive viability it’s blaziken by a mile, with infernape, charizard, and incineroar all being quite good at certain times",pokemon
I have one question: Will there be Evolution? That's literally my only question about the game,while we know nothing about the game I can confidently say that I would be SHOCKED if evolution wasn’t in the game,pokemon
"if they switched out Oshawott with Froakie, it would be a set of some of the most popular starters, with badass final evolutions, of all generations. Now imagine the set was Chikorita, Popplio, Fennekin-- it probably wouldn't be as appreciated. (don't get me wrong, I think these Pokemon are great, but they seem to be the least popular. FYI I love Chikorita <3)","In my opinion, froakie is overrated",pokemon
Oshawott is in the lower tier of water starters for me. Same with cyndaquil.,Cyndaquil is a fire type so I can totally understand why he would be bottom tier in the water category.,pokemon
I think Meganium is probably one of the least popular starters in the franchise. 🤔,"It's probably the cutest final evolution for the starters, but there really isn't anything special about it. It's a bulky grass type that doesn't even get spore or sleep powder.",pokemon
I's not fair chikorita is set up to fail from the start.,"Seriously, grass is weak to the first two gyms (plus the sixth) and isn’t super effective against any of the Johto gyms or the Elite Four",pokemon
"Bulbasaur is the easiest of the three, at least. Given that Brock and Misty are the first two gyms, it mitigates the need to build a more robust team early on, which is helpful for newer players.

I don't actually know what the overall 'best' starter is, or how you'd even define that. The one that has the easiest time against the 'hardest' gym leader? The one that offers the most not available in other Pokemon from the region (here's looking at you, Chimchar)? The best one for speedrunning a game?

Whatever it is, sadly I don't think Chikorita will be winning under any metric. I love it to death, but it is just... too defensive with a poor move pool.","At least on the early games they balanced the gyms according to the starters, bulbasaur and cyndaquil are the easy mode, squirtle and totodile are medium difficulty and chikorita/charmander are hard mode",pokemon
"In RB I rate Squirtle higher. Yes you lose the easy Misty and Surge matchups, but you're not weak to the strongest type in the game, and you matchup well against the last two gyms and Bruno. Lance too if you teach Ice Beam or Blizzard. (Although Venusaur can exploit the AI there too).",Ice Beam and Blizzard come in handy for Lance too,pokemon
"To be fair, Kanto is a great region for grass types and Johto is a terrible one and that’s got nothing to do with either Pokemon. Bulbasaur has a type advantage against the first 3 gyms and the final gym. Whereas Chikorita has no gym advantages because all the types grass is good against were used for Kanto. If either Pokemon was in the other game, they would have been looked at differently.

That being said, the Chikorita line is the best starter for a number of gyms: lots of gyms in Kanto, Whitney’s Miltank, Chuck’s Poliwrath, Pryce’s gym (because their secondary typings are the worst, oddy Typhlosion is the worst starter against the ice gym), and Clair’s Kingdra.","Oddly Typhlosion is the worst starter against the ice gym? 

Typhlosion wrecks Pryce's Piloswine and Seel and Dewgong have only ice and psychic moves, which are not very effective against Typhlosion. Granted Typhlosion can't one hit them and Meganium can, but they also cannot one hit Typhlosion but can one hit Meganium. For a Nuzlocke, Typhlosion is better vs Pryce than Meganium. Also from the original Gold and Silver, Piloswine has no ground type moves only ice, so Typhlosion can't be one hit KO'd by any of Pryce's Pokémon but Meganium can.",pokemon
I beat all gyms with treecko,No one else is pointing the clearly superior stater,pokemon
"I mean yes, but as a trade-off you have to live with the fact that it becomes a 'roided broccoli.",I stand by this.,pokemon
Isn’t Lorelei a ice type specialist so she has super effective moves on a grass type? Sure Lapras is part water type but still,"Technically yes, but 4 out of 5 of her pokemon are Water type, not just Lapras. So from a type advantage pov Venusaur can enter that battle at no more disadvantage than her own pokemon are. The only exception is Jynx.",pokemon
I feel oddly protective of animated chibi Dawn.,"Here's another one if you think this is more appropriate, lmao

I dont wanna make people angry. But thats an sword shield female and male basemodels with a hair mesh . means we are gonna get different hairstyles and. Suits for this game.

Do you have like a backpack bulb or even just a bulb cushion I guess? Curious cause you know bulb-asaur. Either way nice work.," I do I do I promise! Kinds regretting not adding a photo where if shows haha! But u can,kind of see it in the first photo! (White flower on my shoulders r straps!) Thank u though! 💫",pokemon

Great work. It's really cool.,Thank you!!,pokemon
*T pose*,Asserting dominance,pokemon
Very good,Thank u!,pokemon
"Omg it looks so awesome!! I remember like 11 years ago, I always went to those Pokemon Days, where a bunch of Pokemon Fans met each other. This was the first time I saw cosplayers. My Mum asked (cause I was too shy) where they got those costumes from. I was stunned to oblivion as I heard that they are self sewn, they all looked so awesome and you brought the feeling back of 11 y/o me walking between all those 16/17 y/o with their beautiful costiumes.",Omg what the heck this is so wholesome!!thank u so Ooo much I rly appreciate it! And  I'm glad I could bring bring feeling back! 🥺💫💗,pokemon
Love it!,Thanks!!,pokemon
This looks so good,Thank u!,pokemon
Very cute. Looks amazing!,Thank u! 💫,pokemon
Hello,Hi lol,pokemon
T pose to show dominance,Of course u think a wild bulbasaur would just sit there and take it smh no I must assert my dominance!,pokemon
"You are SO CUTE!!!!!!!

Bulbasaur is easily the best starter in all of Pokémon (don’t even @ me), and you 100% did my little bulby boi justice. 11/10 cosplay, take my well-deserved upvote!",Ahh ur too sweet thank you so much! And lol I agree bulbasaur is def up in my top 3 starters! Rly glad u think I did it justice tho!!!!! 💗,pokemon
She looks like a Tales of Symphonia character in your edit.,"And here I thought I was the only one who saw the resemblance in this, it's definitely the face",pokemon
"Bro I just can't get over the arms. I mean, I can, it's just a nitpick, but they look like long branches with hotdogs attached to the ends (Smol Dawn is cool tho).

I vote to make 'em stubs--stubs make everything more adorable. Take a note from Kirby. You ain't finding fingers there.",I would also take animal crossing-esque balls instead of hands,pokemon
"personally, i just want outlines. outlines would make me happy.","I saw someone on Twitter who did an edit where they just added outlines, and I didn't like it as much. It felt like it clashed with the intended style which is supposed to look like plastic toys, not 2D animation. But when you add the cel shading as well, it brings it together and makes a preferable alternative to the plastic style.

Or maybe this person just did a better job adding outlines. Or it's both. Probably both.",pokemon
Yeah this would make the world less muddy. Textures blend together too much from the videos,"Yessss, it's hard to tell where Barry ends and the environment begins",pokemon
"Hear me out: 2D stylized graphics. Not just pixel art, but decent, hand-drawn 2D art instead of this 2.5D 3DS launch title energy","I’ve wanted this for Pokémon ever since they made the switch to 3D. There was charm in the pixel sprites, the battle sprites for Pokémon where always in a dynamic pose instead of just standing there. If they went the Street Fighter 2 HD Remaster route I would be so happy",pokemon
So cell shading is what Smash 4 3DS had? I never knew the technical term fo it,"It isn't, cel shading refers to the lighting technique, not thick outlines. Think of the way Wind Waker looks, each surface only has two different shades that depend on the way the light hits the object. That game also has thicker outlines though, so it's easy to see where the confusion comes from!",pokemon
I mean it’s an interesting approach but I feel like it conflicts with the rest of the environment too much. Looks out of place.,"That's only because OP half-assed the concept of it. With cel shading the world would look similar to his concept of Dawn. As he suggests now, yeah you're right because it's two completely different art styles clashing but the game wouldn't have these two awkward styles if cel shading was pursued.",pokemon
"And doing this wouldn't actually take a lot of time. Creating a cel shader probably takes about a week, maybe two.

It can definitely be done before release if they listen to the feedback.","Yeeeee I feel like asking for a change to the shader would be more realistic than asking for them to remake all the models to look like recent games. I hope they do listen to feedback, tho that relies on us being a majority instead of a vocal minority and them listening at all in the first place so iunno -u-“",pokemon
this looks better but honestly hot take here why did pokemon have to go 3-D? nothing against ORAS or X/Y I liked those games but why go 3-D I feel like the series lost some charm,"I think it was cuz it was less work/makes more animations possible? With 2D animation, every frame of an animation needs to be drawn by hand, with 3D animation you make a 3D model and use that as a base for the rest, and can reuse it for later games while updating the render. That said there was definitely a certain charm that I kinda miss CX",pokemon
Sausage Fingers? Sausage Fingers!,"Hands I have the skill to draw, you mean!",pokemon
"Pokemon fans: I REALLY hope the remakes don't have sword and shields art style

Also Pokemon fans: I wish the remakes had sword and shields art style.",It's almost as if everyone here isn't a single homogeneous group with everyone having carbon copy hopes and expectations.,pokemon
I wonder what engine they're using to make the BDSP games. Could it be something that restricts how they can actually texture?,since they're so nostalgic they're probably just emulating the DS,pokemon
"The game isn’t even finished, give ILCA some time","About 7-8 months, what we saw in the trailers is pretty much the final product if they don't delay, what I'd be fine with; ""a delayed game eventually is good, a rushed game is forever bad""",pokemon
But how does it look in motion? I think that in motion the new art style is very nice but I don't like it in screenshots.,Genshin is a good example of cel shaded 3D models in motion but they don’t have any chibis afaik,pokemon
"Didn't everyone complain about the ""ugly"" outlines in the past Pokémon games and wanted them gone? People even created mods for the more recent Pokémon titles that removed the outlines altogether, making the game look more smooth. And now that they got rid of them, the majority wants them back.","Really? I love outlines in games styled like, well, anime/manga.",pokemon
"The cel-shading brings out the low rez textures, I mean just look at dawn's eyes.",I mean nobody is forcing them to have that low res textures.,pokemon
"I like how that looks, but they need to make clear that the anime and the games take place in different universes.",Yes but the Female leads were the same in games and Anime,pokemon
[deleted],"No, it’s my edit, I did this up in Procreate, I have no idea who TT is. Looking them up, if anything TT’s linework is better but they didn’t do any cel shading",pokemon
"Very good work.

But for my money, just give me Samurott standing up. It's quite similar to Typhlosion standing up. It totally works. I have no idea why they made him so awkward in the 3D games.

It's a shame Samurott didn't get a few minor changes that would've made it pretty good instead of kind of good looking. I personally think the horn looks a little slapped on and would've looked less like an awkward unicorn if it were fatter, at least at the base.",pokemon
I always hated how Samurott devolves into a quadped after evolution. Like it has swords on it’s arms but it can’t even use it properly.,And i always hated how snivy loses its legs,pokemon
Love the design. Samurott is one of the few PK that I think should’ve been bipedal.,Its Biped when it lunges at you with its sword. Similar to Typhlosion I think.,pokemon
I prefer this over samerruott,No I cannot spell,pokemon
Where the **** was this when galar variants were announced? This is awesome!,It wouldn't make any sense for a galar variant which are based off Victorian England..,pokemon
"I like Greninja more than Samurott but I agree that Oshawott was the best choice for water. Between Ash Greninja and its inclusion in Smash Bros, Greninja already has enough attention. Glad this game is showing love to the overlooked starters",When is my Serperior getting love,pokemon
"I saw some guy reacting to the trailer, and he was all, ''Cyndaquil is so lame. They should have put in Charmander,'' and someone else was all ''Ah, Rowlet is such a waste of a slot. I want Treecko.'' And I'm just feelin' like ''Haven't they gotten enough attention already!?''

Gamefreak said they wanted to give more Pokemon a chance to be in the spotlight, and while that was a complete lie in regards to SwSh, I'm happy that protocol finally seems to be getting carried out.","I saw that same trailer!!! Like Charmander? Seriously? That's the most unoriginal choice, but you like what you like I guess. And for sure, in gen 8 it seemed misleading but it looks like that statement applies here in these games!!",pokemon
Same I love my samurai otter,Forever and always my number one,pokemon
"Ninjas weren’t even loyal to the shogun. Reading Japanese history would explain Oshawott’s appearance
Edit: Many of you have given me a history lesson. It seems I still have much to learn before posting “facts” on this platform","Oshawott makes so much more sense. Even that aside, I'm just happy he's getting chosen in favor of more popular water starters",pokemon
I like the Fraokie line more but yeah the Oshawott line deserves more love.,I respect you so much sir/madam,pokemon
They chose some of the best starters for this game I swear,"Ugghh I agree. I couldn't have chosen a better trio. (Also your name, I love it)",pokemon
As someone who started playing with soul silver the sole reason I’m hyped for this game is simply so I can choose cyndaquil as my starter again,"Facts, cyndaquil is goated",pokemon
"My only hope is that somehow this translates to them getting some love via new moves or what have you.   


Also nothing against Oshawott, but I really wish they made it's final form look less stiff. It's why I dislike Salamance","I for sure hope for some new moves too :( Samurott needs Dragon Dance or Shell Smash. And wow, that's a first! I haven't seen many dislike Salamence. Not that I mind, not a favorite of mine either",pokemon
Oshawott's evelutiom chain takes him from the dopy kid who is last to be picked in gym to a boss ass samurai. I love him (:,I resonate with Oshawott! As someone who was the last to be picked in gym class to someone who now puts in the effort to take care of himself...he's relatable!! Oshawott is so adorable,pokemon
I'm so happy cyndaquil is a starter in legends it's my favorite Pokémon,"I'm so happy with this selection. You have Oshawott, my favorite Pokemon, Cyndaquil, who is my favorite fire starter and among my favorite Pokemon, and Rowlet, who is another diverse starter in the group who turns into the very cool Decidueye. This is my favorite starter trio to date now",pokemon
"Oshawott makes perfect sense. It's a Samurai pokemon.          

Rowlett makes sense as it's essentially Robin Hood.         

Cyndaquil makes sense, because he is the rolliest polliest widl fire type! :3",Cyndaquil is just so adorable <3 I'm so happy with this trio!!,pokemon
I like Froakie/Greninja a lot better but Oshawott doesn’t get much love tbh so it makes sense.,"*LET ME HAVE THIS*

Lmao jokes aside though, I know how it feels to have your favorite neglected. He'll get to shine another day, you'll see!",pokemon
Yes I love oshawott but I’m gonna probably pick rowlit since he’s my homie and my first stater but I might pick oshawott for the same reason since my first PKMN game was a spin-off called Pokepark 2 and oshawott was my favorite one in tha game of the playable cast,"PokePark 2 is actually the reason Oshawott is my favorite Pokemon. A clumsy, cocky yet caring detective. Hell yes. But hey I get it, homies come first, if Rowlet is your homie you can't betray him. I'll take care of Oshawott, no need to worry",pokemon
I think Greninja would have messed up the starter advantages. It would have an advantage over both Typhlosion and Decidueye because of the water/dark typing.,"Oooh, good point!",pokemon
"Actually I like it better that it’s Oshawott, samurai are more respected in ancient Japan and were amazing historical figures, and Greninja already has enough popularity, I grew up loving Charizard and he is my favorite Pokémon, so I understand how people can get frustrated to see the same Pokémon get all the attention, I like these starters and it’s good that they used the one with less recognition, he also makes more sense than Greninja too.","Well said! I think Oshawott is the perfect choice, biases aside (or not lmao). I love that they're giving attention to Pokemon they haven't given any to in a long time",pokemon
"I appreciate that Oshawatt was picked, but it really doesn't matter to me since I'll just deposit whichever I choose into the PC the first chance I get. Lookout world, me and my 5 magikarp are on the move!","GOOD LUCK TO YOUR MAGIKARP, YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT!!",pokemon
"I like what they chose, all of the starters they chose are loved by a lot of people but haven’t gotten much attention from Gamefreak",Couldn't have said it better myself!,pokemon
I'm more concerned for my baby boi Dunsparce. This is supposed to be based on feudal japan right? If so I'm hoping they remember to add the tsuchinoko boi himself.,Hahaha let's hope!,pokemon
The fraokie line doesn't need more attention. I believe in samurai otter supremacy,"I agree. Don't get me wrong, I love Froakie and Greninja, but I've seen cooler Pokemon. And he got everything a Pokemon fan could dream of. It's Oshawott's turn!",pokemon
Oshawatt is my favorite Pokémon,Same here!,pokemon
ok but. How sick would it be if Greninja was the villain/Villains pokemon,Okay now THAT I can get behind!! Samurai vs Ninja battle WHEN,pokemon
"I mean,oshawott line is based on ninjas and samurais",It's a win-win,pokemon
"If any sizable amount of non-Sinnoh pokemon will be wild, Froakie and co. would fit better there.

Especially by the Meiji Era, shinobi weren't really a big thing if I recall. They were much further back.","Honestly, I think Oshawott fits way better, bias aside. Ninjas were hired by Samurai. I don't think many non-Sinnoh Pokemon will be there, but if so, Froakie would be a cool addition! It would have its place!",pokemon
"Always loved the squishy water mammal, but I think I might have to go with cyndaquil this time. My boy finally got his flames back","I don't blame you, Cyndaquil's finally getting some justice as well!",pokemon
Oshawott is so great. Best pokemon.,You SPTTIN rn,pokemon
BRuh Oshawott is litty tf yall tripping about?,Exactly!!,pokemon
"Greninja is my ultimate favourite pokemon of all time, but I still thought that Oshawott deserved the role more",Aw thank you on Oshawott's behalf :P,pokemon
"If you ask me, samurai are cooler than ninjas anyway. Samurai are well-trained soldiers with traditional armor while ninjas are just angry farmers with sharp tools.",ANGRY FARMERS HNSJSKSK 😭😭 but agreed! Samurai>>>>ninjas.,pokemon
"Also it’s not like shinobis were as big a deal as people and anime make it out to be(looking at you, Naruto)","You mean the Sinnoh anime? It was by far my favorite since I group up with Sinnoh, but it definitely is just another season of Pokemon, so I agree. I feel like Pokemon is hardly even an anime tbh (which I don't mean in a bad way)",pokemon
Omg same i love samurott I don’t get why ppl think it’s weak,"I use Samurott in competitive all the time. It takes some time to know what works, but once you do it kicks so much ass",pokemon
Oshawott FTW!!!,YESSSS,pokemon
Oshawott fans! Unite!,Oshawott fans raise your hand 🖐,pokemon
Tbh I love the pics for the starters! I feel like Typlosion is so under appreciated. Greninja get enough rep in Smash.,"Typhlosion is popular, he just gets no attention, I'm glad to see him back. Greninja has Smash, his other form, and just...everything else. I'm so excited for the starters they chose!!",pokemon
"honestly? all three of the chosen starters for the game are my favorites, i love em, i would be happier if torchic was there due to him being my favorite pokémon, but the ones chosen make me really happy","They'll give Torchic attention in a future game, I'm sure of it. But I'm glad you're happy with the selection!!",pokemon
I am just so happy it isn’t a gen 1 starter for the 100th time. I can finally pick my boy cyndaquil again,"Same, I'm so surprised with the lack of gen one!! Can't complain here!",pokemon
"I mean I like Greninja, but Samurott is a otter and a samurai with a good looking bear, I need to say more ?","No sir, you would have sold me on Samurott if I wasn't a fan already!",pokemon
Oshawott is best water type starter (except maybe piplup he is pretty cool too),"If it wasn't for Oshawott, Piplup or Popplio would be my favorite water starters for sure",pokemon
There will be no debate on who I pick as a starter,Saaame,pokemon
"I like Froakie, but I feel like Oshawott is a better fit. Can we talk about Cyndaquil though? I think Tepig would have been a better choice. Emboar just seems like it would fit better with Decidueye and Samurott. It gives me an old school blacksmith vibe.",Emboar DEFINITELY fits better imo. I just think they wanted 3 different generations. Emboar would have been so good tho,pokemon
"Absolutely agreed. Greninja has seen enough spotlight.

I don’t exactly like Samurott - I just don’t think he was that usable in his introductory generation - but delighted to see him get a shot again.","Samurott was great in game but...man, he sucks online if you don't use him right. I think they'll do him better this time :]",pokemon
I think it’s best to just trust their choices. I’m sure someone did a lot of research to accurately portray certain themes,"I believe so too. Whoever all chose the trio did a great job, since we already figured out the theme!",pokemon
"Greninja would’ve been too obvious, plus the ninja’s were enemies of the samurai and the shoguns. Iirc, ninja’s were peasants and farmers that rebelled against the shoguns.","This just goes to show, Oshawott>Greninja!",pokemon
"""meh meh meh greninja""

GEN 5 GANG CANT HEAR YOU PLEASE EXIT THE PREMISES",GRENINJA GANG SOUNDS AWFULLY QUIET RN‼,pokemon
"Oshawott deserves some attention tbh

I get the feeling it's gonna be a bit before we see bw remakes so why not give the lol guy some much deserved love. Now... who should I choose from Cyndaquil or Oshawott? 🤔","I agree! He's deserved some looong overdue attention. And honestly....both are goated! They're so adorable. I'm personally going for Oshawott because it's my all time favorite Pokemon, but that's just me :]",pokemon
"No, no, see, this is where the rival comes in. Pokemon that represent the forces that aligned themselves against the Shogunate and central government of Japan. Greninja would represent the guerrilla tactics of revolting peasantry. Emboar to represent the historic growing threat of China, who would soon go to war with Japan (in 1894). Maybe Rillaboom to represent invasive Western culture.

Eh, Rillaboom is iffy. Maybe Chesnaught instead?",Oooh okay this is a hella good point tho,pokemon
"Yeah, Greninja is a ninja, but you know who else is a ninja? Decidueye! They made their choice. Deal with it!",Can I hug you? Thank you,pokemon
"I couldn't care less which starters were chosen

my favorite pokemon r all final starters, gardevoir, and gllade",I resonate with that! Most of my favorite Pokemon are starters,pokemon
Yes. Thank you,Ofc Oshawott gang represent,pokemon
"Always loved Oshawott, it was the first pokemon I had in the games","Everyone out here flexing Oshawott was their first 😩 mine was Turtwig, a friend for sure but Oshawott is Oshawott",pokemon
"I adored sea otters since before Pokemon was even a thing, I will defend Oshawott to the death.",I will defend him right there with you,pokemon
"It's going to be so difficult, both Samurott and Typhlosion are two of my favorites. I might just cheese with pokemon home and get both",Hahaha I might too :P,pokemon
TYPHLOSION!!!!!,HIS FLAMES ARE BACKKKK,pokemon
The 3 starter Pokémon in Legends are 3 of my favorite starters so no matter what I’m gonna be both happy and sad.,"I feel it :[ Oshawott is my favorite Pokemon, but Cyndaquil and Rowlet go so hard too",pokemon
Yep. Oshawott deserves love. Oshawott is best Water type,Absolutely agreed!,pokemon
I believe in Oshawott superiority,Let's start a religion,pokemon
I didn’t think there were Oshawott fans... I guess anything is possible these days.,It's not just me...? Where were you when I needed you 😭,pokemon
As someone who really likes greninja: I’m gonna be really happy with my rowlett starter :),Aw I'm glad to hear :],pokemon
Samurott is the better pick. Let the Oshawott fans have it,Exactly,pokemon
Average Frog Ninja Fanatic vs Average Samurai Otter Enthusiast,LMFAO CAN I USE THIS FOR A POST?!?! I'll give you credit!!,pokemon
"I know it wouldn't fit, but I would be ecstatic if Popplio was a starter.  It's genuinely my favorite starter of all.  Primerina is amazing.

What I don't get it why Cyndaquil?  Typhlosion really doesn't seem to fit if they were going for something like an Edo era fighter.  I get archer and samurai.  Why not Fennekin for the wizard if you go the fantasy route?","I would have loved Popplio as well, it is my second favorite water starter. It is slept on so much",pokemon
YES FINALLY OSHAWOTT IS MY FAVOURITE STARTER THANK YOU YESSSS,😼,pokemon
"oshawott is the best and logical choice, let my samurai otter rule the sinnoh region",Yesss!! Oshawott is the first recorded pokemon to battle Arceus now technically :P,pokemon
Greninja is the Charizard of water types,Is there a charizard of grass?,pokemon
Weebs who've never seen anything about Japan other than anime and -very- few sources that likely have confirmation bias be like 'nInJa FrOg',"This is based, literally. ""BuT nInJa FrOg MaKeS mOrE sEnSe ThAn ThE sAmUrAi"" like no bud, you just want Greninja to be the next Charizard (implying he isn't already)",pokemon
Oshawott was my first ever starter,"**hrmmm my first ever starter, oshawott was.** 

*-Lordhelmet767*

^(Commands: 'opt out', 'delete')",pokemon
Oshawott is in my top 3 favorite starters.,He deserves it :P,pokemon
Oshawott > Froakie,PREEEEEACHHH,pokemon
"I love Oshawott and Dewot but honestly, I think Samurott is one of the worst designed starters. He doesn’t even look like the rest of his family. 

Don’t kill me, just my personal opinion.","Hahaha no worries, you're always entitled to your own opinion",pokemon
Oshawott’s literally my favorite Pokémon so I am *so* happy for this.,Aw Oshawott fans unite!,pokemon
Who knows maybe Greninja will appear in a gym or village or something,"Gyms prolly aren't gonna be a thing in this game, I'd be wary",pokemon
Yesss,😼,pokemon
If not for needing a fire type I think we might have seen froakie as an option.,Possibly!!,pokemon
"Meh, I love both Oshawott and Froakie, they're my starters of their gen",They both cool fo sho,pokemon
I’m super happy they went with Oshawott. He’s my favorite starter of all time.,"Same here, I was SO shocked!!",pokemon
oshawott is the first starter i ever picked and dewott is officially the best,Yessss,pokemon
Samurott gang,Yessss,pokemon
Yeah we need more underrated starters like chespin,"I would have chosen Chespin instead of Rowlet, but this is still an awesome trio!!",pokemon
I’m just happy that I have the pick from all Pokémon I chose,:],pokemon
"If I ciuld choose it would be: Totodile, Bulbasaur and Chimchar","Nice choices!! If you replace Totodile with Oshawott, that's pretty close to my dream squad!",pokemon
Plus Decidueye is already kind of a stealthy bowman and kinda looks like a ninja,Decidueye definitely looks like a ninja!,pokemon
Oshawott is by far my favorite water starter. Gen 5 is the only one I would pick water over fire.,Oshawott is just that cool 😎,pokemon
Def picking oshawott,Yessss,pokemon
Samurott is cool,Agreed!,pokemon
"Tbh,I’m happy we got gen four remakes..cause I want them? no! I just want gen 5 remakes!","I started in gen four, so I'm super happy to see them. But we're now closer to seeing gen 5 remakes!!!",pokemon
Bruh how do they expect me to pick between Oshawott and Rowlet,"*whispers Oshawott in your ear*

Haha fr tho, they're both sooo goated",pokemon
I just want snivy but at least theres 1 gen 5 starter,"Snivy would have been my choice as well, but I guess they didn't want to do more than one of each generation",pokemon
I love Oshawott! His personality in the anime sealed him as my favorite Pokémon.,Same here! Ash's Oshawott and PokePark 2 are the reasons he's my favorite!,pokemon
Oshawott best starter,Absolutely!!,pokemon
"Yes. I would say I wish Snivy was the grass starter, but 
1 it’s stats are bad
2 it probably wouldn’t fit with the game, since these starters were chosen for a reason.","Snivy's line is my favorite Grass Starter, but I can admit Rowlet fits more. It also makes the trio more diverse!",pokemon
100% Oshawott gang🙏,We stand united 🙏,pokemon
I absolutely hate oshawott and still think it was the right pick,"I respect you asf, this is what we need to see more of",pokemon
"Oshawott is great, he 3rd evolution is the biggest letdown of any evolution line imo","I disagree, but to each their own :]",pokemon
"I thought that it'd make more sense if they went with Finnikin so we'd have the Archer, Swordsman, and the Mage.",Fennekin would have been dope! Although I won't complain with Cyndaquil. Fennekin will get its time though :],pokemon
I mean yeah it would be awesome to have Froakie instead of Oshawott but i love both of them,Froakie will get its time again!! Don't worry :],pokemon
"I agree with this completely, and before launch I was completely indifferent to both pokemon.

But why cyndaquil?

You have a samurai

An archer

And a hedgehog?

Why no infernape for the Japanese folklore? Why no blaziken for ninja/martial arts? 

I love cyndaquil, but why is he here?","I think they're not doing Infernape simply because it's gen 4, and they want to give the other generations a shot. Agreed, I love Cyndaquil but it definitely makes the least sense",pokemon
"Greninja is fucking overrated, just like charizard and blaziken, and I'm sick of hearing about it.","Ugghh same here. I like Greninja, but it isn't one of my favorites. Charizard I'm sick of, and Blaziken is my least favorite starter to exist",pokemon
Samurott is literally a samurai.,EXACTLY!!,pokemon
"I love Oshawatts line. I loved Gen 5. I ran him with Icebeam, revenge, surf, and waterfall. Oshawatt kicked ass. Revenge covered his speed, Icebeam covered a huge weakness and his special and attach were decent.  Solid starter IMO. Maybe not the best competitive. But who cares. Enough to reck the main game.","Exactly! The main campaign is the most fun anyway, and Oshawott destroys everything in the main game",pokemon
"A bunch of people keep questioning why Oshawott, but someone did a theory post the other day that was really interesting on why it makes more sense for starters to be from Unova, Alola, and Johto vs elsewhere. Check it out [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/luac5e/theory_arceus_legends_story_will_be_based_on_the/)","I'll give it a look, thank you so much!",pokemon
Exactly. I've always liked Oshawott's line. Plus Samurott's cry is awesome.,Samurott's cry is like...it's so badass!,pokemon

"Samurai, Archer, and Volcano Mouse","Aka, the Arceus Trio. The chosen ones by god himself",pokemon
Greninja may be my favorite pokemon but Oshawott is my second favorite and he deserves some more love,Hahaha they're both pretty cool!,pokemon
"Samurai are loyal to the emperor more so than the ninjas so it makes sense anyways, even if oshawott looks the way he does, his grown up self is quite cool",I personally love how Oshawott looks </3 but agreed! Samurott is badass!,pokemon
"I like Oshawott, Oshawott look like they’d be nice to be friends with",Yessss they look friendly asf,pokemon
I'm still picking Rowlet,Well I mean Decidueye is badass,pokemon
"samurott is dope af, easily best unova starter",Yesss,pokemon
I would say I like Oshawott and Grenada equally I’m glad I Oshawott got the spotlight this time tho and I’m definitely picking Oshawott gen 5 feels kinda underrated,Hope you have fun with Oshawott!! <3,pokemon
deeper,Ayo we're trying,pokemon
"Oshawott is the only one I questioned honestly. Sorry m8. My perfect lineup would be chikorita, piplup, and cyndiquil",We're just different people </3 that's okay though!,pokemon
I support this 500%,You are welcome Shiny Dewott 😼,pokemon
Not having gen 2 and 5 starters in galar makes so much more sense now,True!,pokemon
"I'd rather have my Samurotter. That being said, I'll be extremely surprised if Froakie isn't catchable.","I don't think we'll have many Pokemon outside of Platinum's Pokedex. Since the starters were brought from their original regions, I wouldn't be surprised if the other starters got left behind. I'd just be wary if I were you :P although I personally don't mind this",pokemon
My three bois and i have to choose between them.,I'm so sorry 😭 good luckkk,pokemon
"Exactly! Greninja can be a member of the bad guys team or something, let the main character choose the samurai otter!",Greninja as a villain would be SWEET. But Oshawott as the protagonist??? Yessirrrr,pokemon
Where my empoleon homies.,"Samurott may be my favorite, but I still love Empoleon!!!",pokemon
"I'm so glad that Oshawott is getting some more love and attention. I love Cyndaquil as well, which is why I got a Cyndaquil plushie in my room, but Oshawott is just so adorable and from the gen 5 starters, my all time favorite! I get why people aren't so hyped about Samurott and wamt Greninja, but Samurott will always be my guy, since he was the first pokémon that I got to level 100. Greninja got enough attention so it's nice that they're giving some spotlight to starter pokémon that aren't as popular. 

And Rowlet.. well I chose him in Ultra Sun & Moon and his design is pretty dope, but Litten and Incineroar with his disturbing amount of muscles kinda made me fall in love with it as I was playing the game..","I'm probably the biggest, or at least one of the biggest Oshawott fans around, I'm sooo happy he's getting attention too. All three of these starters are awesome imo. And same!! Samurott was my first legit level 100, I'm so proud that it was him",pokemon
Oshawott gang rise up,🖐 right here,pokemon
Oshawott is my favorite starter ever lol.,Your taste is exquisite,pokemon
I like both.,They're both dope!,pokemon
I don't even like Greninja that much. But I LOVE Froakie goddammit.,Froakie cute for sure!,pokemon
"Serperior and Samurott are underrated only because Emboar's design is hot garbage:

Change my mind","I personally love all three, but I do think if Emboar looked different, the trio would be much better recieved",pokemon
Oshawott is my favorite starter cause samurai sea lion is awesome!,Same here!,pokemon
"“They should’ve chosen Froakie because Greni-“ Greninja is overrated. There, finished the sentence for you",YOU'RE A GENIUS!!!!,pokemon
"I feel the same about Cyndaquil! My three favorite starters from those regions, what am I to do?",Augghh they're all so good 😩,pokemon
I'm still gonna pick Rowlet no matter what. My favorite grass starter for sure.,Hope you have fun with your archer birb <3,pokemon
What happened exactly? I think I missed something,Look up the new Pokemon game called Pokemon Legends: Arceus,pokemon
honestly greninja is the water equivalent of charizard if not close to it,Absolutely! 100%,pokemon
I’m just happy gen 4 is remade,Same <3,pokemon
Greninja fans just have the impression that all oshwatt are shellfish because we’re all happy,I did meet one guy like that now that you mention it...,pokemon
"Don't get me wrong, I love Froakie, but I also only used Oshawott in my Gen 5 playthroughs... they are great in their own separate ways!",Agreed! Well said!,pokemon
"from a competitive standpoint, these are bad starters. from a fan standpoint, the funky owl, otter and vaguely rodent looking thing are pretty cool!","Agreed! I usually go by design anyway, so I'm very pleased!",pokemon
At least they didn’t chose chikorita lmao,💀 that would have been something else. I wouldn't have minded but I mean it wouldn't have even compared to Oshawott or Cyndaquil,pokemon
Chosen for what?,Look up the new Pokemon game. Pokemon Legends: Arceus,pokemon
Context?,Look up the new Pokemon game called Pokemon Legends: Arceus. It's wild!!,pokemon
"While I like Greninja’s water shurikens, I think that Samurott’s shell swords/katanas are way cooler.",Agreed 100%,pokemon
greninja gets too much attention for having a cool design. Oshawott actually holds memories for me.,^THIS,pokemon
Totodile or gtfo,To be fair...Totodile is goated,pokemon
"Honestly oshawott and Dewott are my favourite starter line from gen 5, I just don't like samurott. I loved the look of Dewott using his shells and he could've been a good rival starter to greninja's shurikens",Dewott vs Greninja WHEN,pokemon
Best Water Starter will always in my opinion be tied between mudkip and oshawott,They're both goated AF,pokemon
"Greninja is in fucking Smash, let Oshawott have his moment",THANK YOU,pokemon
I’m excited to use Samurott again. I low key hate the cyndaquil line it’s design is nothing special (at least they got the flames back it looks like) and PChalTV has taught me that Typhlosion and Charizard have the exact same base stats... so charizard is just better. Pretty indifferent to Rowlet though.,I love PChalTV! Although I'll always love Cyndaquil hahaha. Samurott is definitely awesome though :P,pokemon
Thanks you for blessing me with this meme,"Ayo anytime, Oshawott and I will continue to bless the land",pokemon
"As much as I like greninja oshwott is just Soo cute, and it's evolutions is really cool.",Oshawott is so adorable <3,pokemon
"Samurott is literally based off of a samurai. Greninja's cool I get it, but Samurott fits a lot better for the time period they wanna go for.",Exactly!!!!,pokemon
Cries in totodile,😭😭 your day will come!!!,pokemon
"I can appreciate this, gen V and II starters get little love. If there is an eviolite in this game I'm keeping it as a Dewott, though!","Dewott is hands down the COOLEST middle evolution, only rivaled by Quilava and Torracat imo",pokemon
"Samurais against Ninjas

Longest confrontation the weebs have ever seen",Hahahahaha this is true!,pokemon
"I’m confused, what is this oshawott thing ur talking about",This was written by a Game Freak employee,pokemon
We Oshawott fans shall rise!,!!! It's our time!! I actually never thought this day would come!,pokemon
Even if you don’t agree with oshawott being the starter. We’ve seen piplup in the trailer so you can still get different starters outside of the ones in the beginning.,"I think it'll be limited to the Sinnoh starters, but I'm okay with that! I adore all 3 of them",pokemon
"My favorite Pokémon!

Oshawott gang rise up",He's my favorite too!! It's our time to shine!,pokemon
Dewott is my favorite pokemon so 🤷‍♂️ i guess I ain't even mad,Dewott is such a badass favorite!,pokemon
"Greninja is cool, but a ninja doesn't make sense in this context. Plus Samurott is the best water starter in the franchise.",Samurott is SO the best in the franchise :P,pokemon
Sure but I still want greninja back,He will for sure one day,pokemon
"*Oshawott fans, UNITE, FOR THE TIME HAS COME!*",OH MY GOD EVERYONE STAY CALM,pokemon
"I think they should of done starters from regions after sinnoh. My choice would have be Oshawott, Fennikin, and Rowlet",That still would have been super cool!,pokemon
Those earpops dont work. You can still hear something outside.,"That's just me taking a piss, no worries!",pokemon
I am out of the loop. What’s happening with oshawat,"New Sinnoh prequel spinoff ""Pokemon Legends Arceus"" has Oshawott as one of the three starters you can choose from. The other two are Cyndaquil and Rowlet.",pokemon
I just hope they actually have some animations of Samurott standing up with swords in hand LIKE HE'S SUPPOSED TO!!,"We can hope! Although I still love him, quadruped or bipedal",pokemon
Y'all already know I'm sticking with my sweet otter boy,"Same here, you don't gotta ask me twice!",pokemon
"Good meme, and I get why Samurott makes sense, but you can’t make me like that evolutionary line’s design. Dewott is a big improvement on the derpy-looking Oshawott, but then Samurott has to go on all fours? Why choose an otter to fuse with a samurai motif?",Thanks! But nah you don't have to like Samurott of course! To each their own. :P,pokemon
"I like Oshawott's base form but I do hope that they update Samurott's 3D model, like a lot of old pokemon it got a very 1-to-1 remodel that feels flat compared to the pixel version.","For sure. Oshawott's and Dewott's models are great. Samurott's isn't bad, it just needs to do more with the swords. I'm sure it'll have an awesome Razor Shell animation!",pokemon
"People seriously think that there is a better rep than the Samurai Starter for feudal Japan?

I am confused.","Me and you both, Samurott is the perfect choice",pokemon
"But oshawott is a samurai, samurai were loyal to the lord, not ninja.",Exactly!,pokemon
I remember as a kid playing Pokémon BW on my DS I chose Oshawott because the evolution Dewott had the badass move called dual shell where he used his shells as a blade. Memories man. Sweet memories,"Razor Shell is hands down my favorite move, it is SO cool",pokemon
"We stan Oshawott! Woot! I fell in love with the little guy in the anime, and was my go to in the Gen 5 games. How can a samurai otter not be completely awesome?","I have no idea, it is the coolest inspiration for a Pokemon to this day in my opinion! I'm happy he's getting such a big role <3",pokemon
Would it hurt to have more than 3 starters? Specially in this game where no new ones are introduced (as far as we know,"I'm honestly debating on getting Oshawott, Cyndaquil and Rowlet as well as the Sinnoh starters. They're all soooo cool",pokemon
"Same, my friend, same",🖐 unite,pokemon
"*Goes to grab Greninja plush* You’re safe with me little buddy, Reddit can’t hurt you anymore",*grabs my Oshawott plush* so are we duelling or what,pokemon
"Am I dumb or don’t samurais pre date ninjas, thus obviously making Oshawatt the obvious choice","Samurai were also more loyal to the shogun (Typhlosion), ninjas weren't. Oshawott is just a perfect bean",pokemon
Just needs some more coverage moves but I love him and is my favourite of the gen 5 starters,For sure! I feel like it should have gotten the elemental punching moves,pokemon
What is this post indicating though??? Did something happen in the anime?,Look up Pokemon Legends: Arceus... :P it's wild,pokemon
Oshawott becomes a Samurai lol,A damn fine one at that,pokemon
YEAS OSHAWATT but like i fr cried when i saw them in the trailer,I WAS SO HAPPYYYY,pokemon
"If you are familiar with Japanese history, picking Oshawott makes sense. Ninjas weren't loyal to the shogun, samurai were.",Exactly!,pokemon
What are people saying about my boy oshawatt?,"People are saying Greninja would have been a better starter in the new Pokemon Legends game, even when Oshawott clearly fits better 😤",pokemon
"My cousin gave me his pokimon X cartridge 
Once I chose my pokemon he asked ""Who'd you choose?""
""Oh, I chose Fennekin because he's cute. Look, I named him Zuko!""
""Well I chose Froakie because Greninja""
Dude..., let me enjoy my pokemon in peace
(And Oshawatt was one of my favorites growing up, alongside Bulbasaur and Vulpix)",Hahahaha exactly,pokemon
The Samurai Otter RISES ONCE MORE! Join me comrades,WHERE DO I JOIN,pokemon
"Honestly, I like Samurott a lot more than Greninja.",YES,pokemon
I was ok with the starters it would have been cooler to pick non starters though,Imagine picking a Growlithe or a Deino that would be so hype,pokemon
Otter gang,OTTER GANG,pokemon
I'm so glad Im not the only one to see Oshawott make a return,"He's my favorite Pokemon, I never thought he'd see spotlight again!",pokemon
"I’m out of the loop, what happened?","Look up the new Pokemon game, Pokemon Legends: Arceus",pokemon
I agree fully!  I love Oshawott!  My favorite water starter in the series.  Honestly all the starter picks for Legends are great.,I agree! This is the coolest trio to date. The Arcues trio. Chosen by god himself,pokemon
"I see a lot of people defending the Samurai aspect, but it goes deeper than that. 

The Owl, Otter, and Volcano are all part of sacred mythos of the Ainu culture, the indigenous people of Hokkaidō which is what Sinnoh is based on.","Mhm, you're right! I actually only recently learned about that. But those three being the starters just makes it that much more fitting",pokemon
Oshawott my fave Pokémon was going to be my first tattoo but I chose Gaebora over it and then Majoras mask but I’m still saving for Oshawott,"I scheduled my next tattoo for April 3rd! I had a friend draw my team from Super Mystery Dungeon, Oshawott and Snivy. I'm so excited, I can't wait!",pokemon
All this talk about oshawott makes me wanna replay Unova. But should it be Black or Black 2?,"They're both so good!!! Black for the story and setting, Black 2 if you want more content in the post game!",pokemon
OSHAWOTT! OSHAWOTT! OSHAWOTT! OSHAWOTT! OSHAWOTT! OSHAWOTT! DEWOTT! DEWOTT! DEWOTT! DEWOTT! DEWOTT! DEWOTT! DEWOTT! DEWOTT! SAMUROTT! SAMUROTT! SAMUROTT! SAMUROTT! SAMUROTT! SAMUROTT!,HOW DO I PIN A COMMENT,pokemon

"Personally I think Charmander should have been there, as Charizard is the best final evolution, being a fire and a........ A......... A flying. Why the fuck is Charizard still flying fire it's so fucking bullshit. (Ignore this stupid meme)


But yeah Oshawott is adorable and glad to have him.",Oshawott is a friend <3,pokemon
Hot take Greninja is a boring design and I prefer Chespin over all gen 6,"Chespin is so goated, one of my all time favorite Pokemon",pokemon
Tepig fan here. ...Nothing to say. Just thought someone would like to know we do in fact exist.,"While Oshawott is my favorite Pokemon, all 3 Unova Starters are among my favorite Pokemon. I adore Tepig and Emboar, you are not alone :]",pokemon
"Oshawott is amazing, and greninja sucks. Even from a non historical standpoint nintendo made the right choice","THIS ONE RIGHT HERE IS THE CORRECT COMMENT

Like you said, Oshawott is just...he's just the correct choice",pokemon
Oshawott is my favorite Pokémon so I'll never complain.,"I can never complain about the lack of attention again, he's my favorite as well!",pokemon
I have a Shiny Lvl 1 Oshawott sitting in home waiting for this game. So I’m glad.,<3 have fun!!,pokemon
Isn't Oshawottike the #1 least favorite starter?,"Pokemon like Chikorita, Tepig, Fennekin, Chespin, all of the Galar starters are way less popular than Oshawott. Maybe some more in there too, but those ones guaranteed. Oshawott was the most chosen Unova Starter",pokemon
"Me who has always been more incline to chose the water starters since Gen 4. I first chose Oshawott for my first play through of Pokemon black so I'm happy he's here!

&#x200B;

And I was always team Froakie when the Gen 6 starters first got revealed but everyone jumped on the Froakie bandwagon when Greninja got revealed so I chose Fenniken cause im an underdog lol","Oshawott is my favorite Pokemon, I'm so glad he's here! And same, I liked Greninja but I chose Chespin because he wasn't nearly as popular",pokemon
Since we saw the trainer catch a Chimchar in the trailer I'm hoping we can catch a froki in the wild. Still hype for Oshawott,"I wouldn't count on it, since there was a big emphasis on these starters being brought in from their respective regions. Who knows though, Froakie could make an appearance",pokemon
i still wishing that they give Samurott the fighting type,🙏 here's hoping,pokemon
Can't wait for more of my grass boos too come back! Lile my snake boi and leaf dog to come back.,"I hope Snivy is in the game!! She's my third ever favorite Pokemon, just behind Oshawott and Bulbasaur",pokemon
What did i miss? What's going on with the lil guy?,Look up the new Pokemon game called Pokemon Legends Arceus! It's gonna be wild!,pokemon
"Greninja seems to me one of those pokemon overtly designed for the marketing of pokemon products. What are the chances that the most popular starter of the three that gen was given a) a very good set of stats, b) a great hidden ability, c) a very popular shiny and d) a prominent position in the anime?

The others were, by comparison, done dirty.

This is how some pokemon are sadly treated. They're designed to be iconic and imo that makes them less cool.","I've noticed the most popular Pokemon are almost NEVER my favorites. I have favorites that are popular, but not Greninja or Charizard level. And the ones that are considered very popular aren't perfect. They weren't given a big role, don't have great stats, etc. Mary Sue Pokemon like that get on my nerves",pokemon
"Why does everyone always forget Samurott? I mean, he isn't exactly my favorite starter, but he's at least one of the better ones, design wise.","I dunno, I think Samurott is awesome personally. Glad we can agree :]",pokemon
"I was arguing with my friend over how good oshawott is
At least someone other than me loves the little otter boi","Bring me into the argument, I will literally defend Oshawott until I die",pokemon
Chespin is one of my favorite starter,Same here! Chespin himself is so adorable. One of my favorite Pokemon ever in fact,pokemon
Oshawott!,Oshy's back!,pokemon
"As a Smugleaf fan, my Smugleaf and I are fine. Not like we wanted to be a part of your dumb game anyway. *soft sobbing sounds*","While Oshawott is my favorite Pokemon, Snivy is my 3rd ever favorite. I'm hoping she's in the game just as much as you are 😭",pokemon
Oshawott best Pokémon starter don’t @ me,@AndrewStout124 I agree! That's my favorite Pokemon!,pokemon
"I raised a shiny perfect IV Greninja with Protean that was very many tries

I’m happy to let someone else take the spotlight","I used to have my own shiny Greninja with Protean that took 495 eggs, I remember those days fondly. But Oshawott is my favorite Pokemon so I'll gladly take him",pokemon
Bro Dewott literally had the most drip outta any of the stage 1 starters like change my mind,"No need, dude has so much drip. I usually end up soaked when near him, and not because he's a water type",pokemon
"Greninja  is ridiculously overrated, imo. Always has been.","thaaaaank you. It's a cool pokemon but I've seen cooler. Like *Samurott.* Or even Decidueye, Luxray, Hydreigon, I can name off so many.",pokemon
My first pokemon ever was oshwatt and he's stayed as my favourite pokemon since then. So glad he's back!,He's my favorite as well! I was absolutely ecstatic to see him,pokemon
"I grew up on gen 5 and Oshawott is my absolute favorite! I'm hoping him (and Rowlet and cyndaquill for that matter) will get more merch from this, because I've been wanting an Oshawott plushie since forever!","Same here! I grew up on gen 4, and then during late elementary school, gen 5 became the newest. Oshawott became my favorite when I was around 11, and it's been over ever since. I've collected so many Oshawott plushies over the years, there are still a fair amount on eBay! Just gotta know how to spot the fakes!",pokemon
"Chikorita fan here, im happy for you getting some love.","Thank you :] I'm a fan of Chikorita as well. Hopefully it gets a big role in the new Snap, but I'm sure her day will come in the main series! We Oshawott and Chikorita fans know how to wait",pokemon
"Oshawott was my first starter ever back in Black and White, my little boy Blooky, we're gonna go back in adventures next year!!",My boi Skipper and I are gonna have a blast as well!,pokemon
Pardon my small brain but why was my boi cyndaquil chosen again?,"Badgers, otters and owls are very important to old Japanese culture. Typhlosion is also based off of a shogun, a military leader in Japan. Archers and Samurai often acted under the shogun's command.

Hope this helped! I didn't know why Cyndaquil was chosen until it was explained to me either",pokemon
"I love all the water starters, but piplup is the goat, water/steel is OP AF. (Edit, autocorrect said pickup instead of piplup)",Piplup is one of my favorites! Empoleon is so goated,pokemon
#OgOshawottGang where you at had mine since White.,"I've adored Oshawott since 5th gen. Snivy was originally my choice, but Ash's Oshawott and PokePark 2 quickly changed that!",pokemon
"God, I don't follow pokemon so seeing this on the popular page, reading it felt like I was having a stroke.","I'll be honest, I made this on the shitter, I had no idea this would be my defining moment",pokemon
Too bad they accidentally forgot to make Samurott a bipedal water/fighting pokemon.,I'm okay with it being a quadruped. The only reason I wish it was bipedal is because it was likely be on Empoleon levels of popularity. It definitely should have been water/fighting though,pokemon
I love Oshawott and Dewott. I just wish Samurott was better designed to match those two more or vice versa.,"Weird thing is, Samurott was actually the first to be designed of its line. Game Freak was just dead set on having the first two be otters",pokemon
treecko > rowlett,Treecko would turn Rowlet into a rotisserie.,pokemon
"Greninja is my favorite Pokemon, but I'm happy that the dope Water-Type samurai is getting some love.

A lot of people hated Samurott mainly due to how it's a quadruped, its beard, or both. In my opinion, removing the beard isn't a good OR bad thing, but it pulls it off nicely. The quadruped thing, though, keep in mind, Samurott is based on a sea lion, *a quadruped animal*. Yusuke Ohmura and the other developers had difficulty designing a big bipedal sea otter (since Oshawott and Dewott are based on sea otters), so they opted for a sea lion instead.

[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Samurott\_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Origin](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Samurott_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Origin)

Plus, when you consider how Samurott would look if it's always bipedal, it wouldn't fully maintain the otter or sea lion inspiration at all. Heck, it would look more humanoid than animal.

That being said, I'm glad to have the opportunity to use it. I debated Rowlet and Cyndaquil (I adore the little guys), but Oshawott is just as cute and has great moves later on.","Yup! I even recall Samurott being the first of its line to be designed. While a sea lion is much different than an otter, Samurott still looks like a giant river otter. Oshawott and Dewott just look like otters standing up. I love the line, despite how different they are.

And for sure! These starters look so fun in this game. Always refreshing to see someone understanding :P",pokemon
Im just happy that Rowlet is the Grass Starter. I love my Owl Baby,So do I. I honestly like all the starters that they chose but I’m picking Rowlet without a doubt and no one can sway my decision,pokemon
"Wasn't Oshawott the leat favourite of the Unova starters when it came out? The Samurott line is amazing and underrated as hell though, so I'm glad my boy Trunks is getting some love","He was originally, but these days he's definitely the most chosen out of the three. Oshawott and Snivy are constantly rivaling each other for the most popular spot :P",pokemon
Did you know greninjas tounge is longer than a skyscraper? (I just thought of something to say i have no clue if this is true),I wish I could pin this comment,pokemon
"They should’ve used Treecko instead of Rowlet, that way it would’ve been monotype starters",Don't take my dead owl from me!,pokemon
"I like all of the starters that they chose and since I’m on the slightly younger edge of Pokémon fans. The first game that I could actually play because it released at a reasonable age was X & Y but since I didn’t have the console to do so, it took me all the way to Let’s Go Eevee to actually play a game, so I’ve never played with any of them. But design wise, I like all of them and I’m not sure which is my least favorite of the bunch because I think they are all really cool.

But I know I’m going to pick Rowlet no question as it is my favorite Pokémon. Even though I never played the video games before Let’s Go I did still love the franchise and when they released Rowlet I was thrilled as my favorite typing is grass and my favorite animal is an owl and this was the best Pokémon ever to me. This game finally gives me a change to play with the little owl as a starter and explore a game with it.","Aw I hope you have fun! And as an aside, I'm an older fan (started with gen 4) and I absolutely loved Let's Go!",pokemon
"# Y E S

Oshawott  was the far superior pick considering the fact Greninja is a ninja and Samurott is an actual samurai like they were going for.",If I could make beeg text I'd do YES with you! Samurai > basic ninja,pokemon
Samurott >  Greninja fight me,You're spittin though,pokemon
"My god I can get on board with this, it’s like ok: you like froakie, you’ve said it before, we know, GET OVER IT!","WELCOME ABOARD

But for real though. Froakie already has had so much attention, it hasn't gotten any recently because it's not gen 6 anymore. And even then, it got a new form during gen 7. Oshawott was unpopular for such a long time, it's his turn!",pokemon
I thought he was the coolest thing when him <3,I still think he's the coolest thing <3,pokemon
"For me Infernape, Samurott and Decidueye will always be the best ones.","Oshawott supremacy forever. Infernape and Typhlosion always rotate as my favorite. My favorite grass starter line is Serperior, but since we can't repeat generations or use a gen four starter, I will 100% take Decidueye, it still is super cool",pokemon
THANK YOU. If they used Greninja they might as well have made Charizard the fire starter. And God knows I can’t deal with any more of that,I agree entirely. I can't deal with anymore of them being shoved down my throat. An ACTUAL original and interesting starter trio!!,pokemon
"I think they were purposely choosing starters that have never really been worshipped by the mainstream community, but have always been generally liked by everyone and have developed relatively big niches of fans.","I think so too! Oshawott especially fits that bill perfectly. While not extremely popular, he's still well recieved for the most part, and aside from the Greninja fans, him being the water starter is being taken well",pokemon
oshawatt is awesome,Yessirrrrr,pokemon
"I don't necessarily like Oshawott and Dewott, but I ***LOVE*** Samurott. If it had been the first starter I ever chose, it would be my favorite. But, as I am old enough to have grown up with Gen 1, Squirtle will always be my fave starter.","Hahaha, Squirtle is a classic. But the Oshawott supremacist in me loves to hear that Samurott could have potentially rivaled that spot <3",pokemon
"yeah i agree, fuck Greninja and fuck Charizard",Say it louder for the people in the back!!,pokemon
Imagine the backlash if charmander was in this game,Pssssshhht oh my god,pokemon
I like Oshawatt and dewott but I dislike samurot honestly,"Perish. 

Lmfao just kidding, that's just how it be sometimes",pokemon
"Me, who doesn’t care about Greninja in the slightest:","Oh hey I made a new friend, nice to meet you",pokemon
 I’m not a big oshawott fan (skipped gen5) but I HATE greninja lol. I don’t get it. I’m excited to use a starter I never got to use :),Aw I hope you like Oshawott then! If that's the one you go for :],pokemon
Fuck froakie all my homies chose chespin,Yes we did,pokemon
My gripe is with cyndiquil. They should have chosen a less popular starter like maybe Charmander. You never see Charizard anymore.,Leon's signature Pokemon was literally Charizard...one of the most popular Pokemon :P,pokemon
"I'm hoping for both, honestly.",I don't think they're gonna have two water type startes but I hope he's in the game for you in this case,pokemon
"If we're going by historical accuracy, Oshawott would make more sense to fight gods and monsters since ninjas were rumored to have come from goblins and demons.",Oshawott is the first recorded Pokemon to fight Arceus confirmed,pokemon
"Greninja is my favorite starter, but yeah it has gotten enough attention. We shouldn't let greninja turn into another charizard","I agree. I actually like Greninja, I don't want it to be a Pokemon I look at and sigh like I do with Charizard",pokemon
"Oshawatt and Piplup share the same problem imo, they are adorable to start but I despise Samorott and Empoleon, kinda the same with Tepig but I actually dont mind Emboar too much","Forgot to mention I'm not downplaying your enjoyment or anything, like whatever pokemon you want :)",pokemon
At least they didn’t pick charmander for the fire type,I was honestly shocked!,pokemon
"I do like Greninja, but I don’t want my frog boi to become another Charizard (which it probably is now). Oshawott definitely needs more love, so it’s pretty cool that it’s having *something* now","Greninja can recover from being the next Charizard. And honestly, it hasn't gotten a ton of fan service lately, so that's good :P Oshawott definitely needed this though hahaha",pokemon
"They couldn’t have picked a better trio for Pokemon Legends, there’s the best water starter, the best fire starter, and one of the top 5 grass starters.

Greninja at this current point is overrated, and Ash-Greninja is even worse than regular Greninja when it comes to that.

I’m really happy with these new Pokemon games, and I hope they’re executed as well as they’re shown. Hopefully gen 9 when it’s released follows the footsteps of these rather than flop like Sw/Sh.","This sums it up perfectly. The best water starter, the best fire starter, and a great grass starter who fits the theme.

Legends is definitely gonna be it's own series, but I wonder if the traditional games will follow in its footsteps, or if Legends will be the new main series? If the traditional games follows this series footsteps, I think it'll start in gen 10",pokemon
"I haven't played since yellow, what the fuck are you guys talking about?","Look up the new Pokemon game called Pokemon Legends: Arceus. If you haven't played since Yellow, this might be the shake up you're looking for.",pokemon
"Yeah, let Oshawott fans have this: it's already hard enough on them living without any sort of taste!","🅱️asic 🅱️eotch

Edit: forgot to clarify I am just joking lmao please don't hurt me or my family",pokemon
"This but with charizard. So fucking tired of charizard. Never understood why it’s popular, but man, game freak and tpc gives it everything while every other starter had to be added as dlc to sword and shield. That’s sad","I didn't even mind dexit, it's just that the moment Charizard and Greninja don't get attention and instead focus on a less popular (but still popular) Pokemon like Oshawott, fans riot. Like it gets boring when the same Pokemon gets all the attention",pokemon
"As a Greninja fan, it sucks I guess. But I get why, I saw a comment that ninja weren't loyal to the shogun or something.","Don't know why you got downvoted, sorry bout that dude. But hey, he'll come back in a game at some point, take it from me. Us Oshawott fans are...used to waiting 🤣",pokemon
"Stat wise, isn’t Oshawott the worst starter?","Competitively, by far. If stats are what you care for, then sure it's a disappointment. But I don't let stats dictate my favorites, since all Pokemon are useable. In game, I'd argue Samurott is actually the best.",pokemon
Oshawott was literally shoehorned into every BW anime episode. He would force himself out of the Pokeballs in episode where he didn’t make sense to be there just so he could be there. lol,"*he was cute okay*

Jokes aside, I feel like that was the only thing going for him. Meanwhile, Greninja got even more attention, new forms, Smash, and was just everywhere. Oshawott was just like a Psyduck/Brock hybrid. He was in a lot of episodes, got merch like every Pokemon, and that was about it. Just my take tho",pokemon
Oshawat definitely worst water starter,"I just couldn't disagree more, but to each their own",pokemon
Oshawott is so ugly lol,*dies*,pokemon
Froakie is the best water starter,I wholeheartedly disagree but hey you like what ya like,pokemon
Didnt k ow that greninja was a stand user...,Wat,pokemon
What is happening??,"I HAVE NO IDEA, THIS BLEW UP ASF",pokemon
Yeah... but our species would have died.,?,pokemon
you exist?,"That is how I'm replying to you now...if you believe you are hallucinating, I would contact a doctor ASAP :P",pokemon
I'm honestly more glad cyndaquil is gonna be one of the starters,I'm happy to see Cyndaquil too!,pokemon
I don't know why but that second image makes me very uncomfortable.,"YOUR USERNAME DOESN'T?! 😭
hahaha same here, it took me awhile to get used to",pokemon
"I like Oshawott, but Samurott is the ugliest fucking Pokemon, why did it devolve into a quadruped?","He's on all fours because *he can't stand it anymore*


Sorry",pokemon
"Me a mudkip fan
🌝",💀 dead,pokemon
"I adore Oshowott, but Greninja, Decicueye, Emboar would have objectively been a better ancient japan trio.

None of them rely on a pun in another language that makes no sense to the majority of the audience, all of them have dual types, and the dual types form a reverse type triangle, making them all equal at the final stage.","How does emboar make more sense? His design is primarily based on a chinese myth. If your referring to his english name being a pun on emperor then your being hypocritical. Typhlosion meanwhile still fits without his japanese name, as the artillery.",pokemon
This just made me realize my boy Farfetch'd is likely going to show up for some awesome duels! (as fodder),The fodder part made me sad 😭,pokemon
Sadly samurott is kinda bad tho,We are two different people... :P,pokemon
"Bruh I am fucking stoked that oshawott got picked, that water type Pokémon, imo, is the best, people dissed on oshawott but oshawott IMO has more potential has the best starter in Gen 5 than the other two, he can even learn dragon tail! (Which is odd cause he barely has one) and idky people dissed him back then that he was “ugly” when he literally pulls a “Careful who you call ugly in middle school” by turning into a badass samurai otter(? Idk but I love him!)

Also sorry for this long comment, I just love oshawott so damn much","Hahaha no worries!! I was like 9 when Black and White released, so I didn't see all the controversy at the time, but I've seen old posts and comments from when he was new, and the fans pulled SUCH a 180. I'm so proud Oshawott is my favorite :]",pokemon
why not both,We'll just have to see won't we? I'm just glad Oshawott is the one getting focus,pokemon
"Samurott is my favourite pokemon, so I was really happy to see him!","Oshawott is mine, I was absolutely blown away!!!",pokemon
Is Legends:Arceus going to be like an advanced pokemon snap?,"Nope, it's a confirmed core title. My guess is that Legends is going to be it's own series, or that it will be the new generation games once gen 9 or 10 releases",pokemon
Oshawott is the worst water starter by far,Bruv,pokemon
Is it wrong for me to love both? Both are my favorite pokemon,Lmao of course not! You like what you like right?,pokemon
No love for totes! Alright ...,"Totodile is already so popular, it's Oshy's turn 😭 much love for the babey though, I've used him in so many HGSS playthroughs",pokemon
I’m old enough to know that charizard is still the greatest starter of all time.,I disagree but hey to each their own.,pokemon
"arent ninjas chinese anyway?  
this is ancient japan or something",Ninjas are from Japan but I think that they are picking Pokemon with samurai inspirations,pokemon
"I'm out of the loop, what's going on?","some people would prefer Froakie/Greninja to be in the Pokemon Legends: Arceus game as a starter, instead of Oshawott/Samurott",pokemon
Context?,"Legends Arceus has Oshawott for its Water starter, along with Rowlet and Cyndaquil",pokemon
wait what is going on with oshawott?,"Water starter in Legends Arceus, together with Rowlet and Cyndaquil",pokemon
But... But... Ninja frog?,Yall forgot samurai otter....,pokemon
I just wanna know why those 3 specific starters. Like I wanna know if theres a story about them cause my god I'm ready to get into it.,This [fan theory](https://www.gamesradar.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-fan-theory-may-explain-why-cyndaquil-rowlet-and-oshawott-were-chosen-as-starters/) has been running around,pokemon
Oshawott is my all time favorite starter. Therefor I’m really glad for what they did,I grew up on BW and I loved oshawatt,pokemon
"Pfft, where's my damn Totodile?  2nd best water starter, after Squirtle.  Though I wouldn't have minded Greninja. 

And while I'm at it, Tepig, Torchic, and Scorbunny > Cyndaquil.

I am happy with Rowlett though.  Might even like Rowlett more than I do Bulbasaur.","Love Totodile, but Squirtle's line is boring to me. They're both pretty popular though, this is huge for Oshawott.

I can say though, I absolutely love Tepig, so I like seeing that!

I like Bulbasaur more, but Decidueye>>>>Venusaur. Bulbasaur is my second favorite Pokemon, but I would have actually been mad if they chose it. No more gen one is needed",pokemon
"I never liked Oshawott, looks too much like a digimon.

Now FROAKIE on the other hand....",We are...two different people :P,pokemon
I don't know any of the words in this meme,•o•,pokemon
"Greninja is my favorite pokemon, and I 100% agree because all the starters there are ones that I would like to use, but except Typhlosion never got to, so it will be fun changing it up a bit",Aw I hope you have fun with the game!,pokemon
Gen five is a contender for worst set of starters design wise,I disagree so hard but to each their own!,pokemon
"Oshawott to Samurott is one of the least organic design progressions though. Definitely the least of the starters. Otter to sea lion with no link in between.

And there's no story/lore to explain it either unlike Gyarados, Milotic, Golisipod etc.","That's not entirely true. Lore wise, for sure, it's lacking. But the way it's based off a river otter (and looks like one), the facial hair, I dunno. While definitely different, I feel like there's enough there. That doesn't take away from an (in my opinion) awesome design. I still say it looks like an otter, even if it's different from the previous two forms. The samurai aspect makes it a much better fit for the context of this game.

Edit: wanted to add that I understand where you're coming from though",pokemon
"I like that it's 3 random starters but, as someone who just finished black again and chose oshawott, I can honestly say oshawott is maybe the worst starter ever","Its not random, Samurott : Samurai, Decidueye : Archer, Typhlosion : Artillery/Shogun",pokemon
"Oshawott is a horrible design. Well, ok, oshawott is ok, but his evolutions are both awful. Froakie was the shit, Greninja is the shit. An otter that turns into a seal with a horn is stupid, and has nothing to do with the theme except his name.","I disagree so wholeheartedly but hey to each their own. Froakie is just kinda boring to me, but that's just my take",pokemon
"Oshawott makes more sense but if Froakie was used they could've swapped the cyndaquil line with tepig, and then all the starters would make sense","Typhlosion references a yokai that was a badger shogun, also its the artillery. How does Emboar make sense? Its primarily based on a chinese myth",pokemon
I feel like something will happen later in development where they change all the starters to charizard,"Don't give them ideas 😭😭 not even Charmander, they just give you a level 100 Charizard",pokemon
"I like greninja much more than I like oshawott, in fact I barely have any experience with oshawott because I didn’t play that gen. But! I’m glad they chose it over froakie. Greninja is already super popular (I believe it was voted one of the top three all time popular Pokémon in japan one year?) let another Pokémon get the spotlight. 

 But overall I’m also just so so glad it’s not just three charizards in different forms. I honestly wouldn’t put it past them at this point. Forget venusaur and blastoise, here’s charizard, green charizard, and blue charizard.","Same here! I like Greninja, but since Oshawott is my favorite Pokemon, it made me so unbelievably happy. And oh my god, they just give you Charizards, not even Charmanders 😭",pokemon
"Greninja has a lot, but I don’t the he has a stand, let alone THE WORLD","Smash, a new form, took over the anime, crowned Pokemon of the year",pokemon
Greninja is better,Never said you can't like Greninja lmao,pokemon
"They were right to not have Froakie. Froakie would have been a pick that’s clearly the “right choice”; the ninja pokemon in the ninja setting, and they would never give you a clear “better” starter that’s not Charmander.","Maybe it's because it's 3 AM for me, but I can't understand this comment, I'm so sorry. What do you mean?",pokemon
"I will be grabing Cyndaquil faster than I can blink because he was my original, and to be honest one of my all time favorites. I just could not face myself if my first run was not with him!",Cyndaquil in Crystal was my first legit level 100. I miss my sweet boy every day. It’s absolutely a no-brainer for me.,pokemon
fluffy owl boi is best boi.,"That was my first Pokémon game, so I’m definitely gonna go with fluffy owl boi. (Yes, I’m a bit late to the party)",pokemon
"This is too easy fluffy owl boi for the win, no better partner in the wild than a archer owl","That's truee, but what about a cool otter boi with two broadswords? Honestly, if they do the scaling and the graphics correctly you won't be able to choose wrong with these starters. I'm getting more and more hyped :D",pokemon
"Idk go with new one to you? Used Rowlet in ultra moon, oshawatt was a tade in b&w and i haven't touched gen 2 so why not fire porcupine. That or trade all 3 onto your team, i mean that could be fun.",My friend and I have been getting opposite versions and restarting multiple times to trade away starters since the OG Diamond and Pearl.,pokemon
"My first game was Silver, and Cyndaquil was my first Pokémon. So happy to reunite with my OG in Sinnoh!","I am slightly happy to not have the option to go with my first starter pokemon... Charizard...

And I had a stronger connection to my second starter anyway. Welcome back cyndaquil.",pokemon
"To me, it'll depend if we can transfer our pokemon from legends to home, if so, I'll use Oshawott (the one I like the least) because I already used the other 2 in past playthroughs.

But if we can't transfer, then it'll be hard to choose between Rowlet and Cyndaquil","I would be surprised if there will be no transferring of pokemon in legends, unless there is some fundamental difference in how the pokemon work (like in go and let's go) then it may just be one way out of the game.",pokemon
"I'll just take my Totodile to go, why are people only choosing from those 3? I've not exactly kept up with details","In a trailer/teaser for a new pokemon game coming out early 2022 they showed these three pokemon as the starters you could choose from. 

It'll be a game set in the Sinnoh region but in the past. The game is called Legends Arceus. It looks like an open world game and resembles a bit Zelda: BotW.

&#x200B;

(Hope that clarifies it a bit :) )",pokemon
"Can you kids stop calling it HG / SS.

It’s GSC.

HG/SS were remakes not the original.",Yeah... I'm talking about the remakes. Heart Gold was the first pokemon game I ever played. Never played the original Gold Silver or Crystal.,pokemon
Very good! Tell him he did a good job!,Of course! XD,pokemon
"It’s not that bad of a trade. Medicham are super easy to find at that point in the game, and even if you can’t get a Gengar, Haunter itself is pretty good, and you’ll have that juicy extra experience",They're literally on the route to the wwest of Snowpoint too,pokemon
They should have remade kanto because that was the first game,They already did. It's FireRed and LeafGreen for the Game Boy Advance,pokemon
"I absolutely LOVE Mudkip, Marshtomp and Swampert (and mega Swampert)",You just can't not love Mudkip,pokemon
Infernape should carry Gible in a papoose so he can keep warm,That image is unbelievably cute! Just gotta find a way to make it fireproof,pokemon
"Absolutely beautiful. I can imagine you on a trek all the way up Mt. Coronet and through Route 216.

I like your take on each Pokemon in your party. I don't see that often in Pokemon fanart (usually I see artists make them look how they normally are--which is ok), yet it oddly feels like that shouldn't be the case.","Thank you so much! In a sense I get it - the Pokemon designs tend to be so solid and refined that it's hard to really ""improve"" on them. But in my head when I play the games they're always a bit different, and I love seeing how other artists interpret them and add their own spin",pokemon
maybe you made to be an ice type gym leader?,...well I think you just gave me an idea for the next one!,pokemon
"I absolutely love ice types, as well.",My favorite type. This picture needs glaceon,pokemon
"To be fair, Gen 4 had the best group of ice types. All bangers.","To be fair, it's normal given how far up in the North and how cold the overall region is compared to the other regions.",pokemon

You also got 2 fighting types though 

May I interest you in a crabominable?","Hmm, I'd like to do a Gen 7 collection too and haven't thought about who I'd include. I've never used crabominable but I do like the design quite a bit (especially because of the real crab it's based on). I'll keep it in mind!",pokemon
In any monotype situation I always pick ice. Fuck stealth rocks!,The only monotype run I've tried is ghost - but ice sounds like a really fun challenge! Which games have you tried it in?,pokemon
Your tactic to defeat cynthia?,"I mean, ice punch garchomp, ez money.",pokemon
is toxicroak really that small??,Probably not :p,pokemon
This is so so cool! I love ice types and Mamoswine was my computer background for a year ha ha,"My first ever shiny was a Piloswine back before it even had an evolution, so it was pretty special to me even when it wasn't very impressive. When I discovered Mamoswine I nearly lost my mind!",pokemon
What was your inspiration for the (Mega?) Infernape design? I know he is based off Sun Wukong but what else inspired you?,"Good catch! It's really just various depictions of Sun Wukong I was drawing from - kind of imagining that this Infernape has a similar personality and tastes so picks up bits of jewelry and armor that match that look. And at first the sketch had him with the usual single flame coming out of his head, but I liked the idea of splitting it in two like how Wukong is somehow depicted. The only other inspiration I can think of is giving him big gauntlets that are meant to look a bit like flame braziers when his arms are down",pokemon

I have a mix of fanart and personal art on my social media pages, but this is my first Pokemon art in a long time (I got my first job in the animation industry roughly 2 years ago and pretty much fell off of social media for a while). I have a few more pieces I'm working on though - I'm playing through the Renegade Platinum hack for the first time and that's inspiring a lot of ideas. So keep an eye out here and on Twitter/Insta, I typically post Mondays and Thursdays",pokemon
"I rarely comment on fanart but I *adore* this. You can really feel the warmth and comradery of your party here. 

It helps that Gible is the best. Someone fetch it a blanket!",Thank you!! And yes Gible is the best! In Pokemon GO I refused to even let mine evolve until I had a second one,pokemon
Froslass and Mamoswine are sooooo good! Honestly better than the originals.,That's a big compliment! Thank you so much!,pokemon
I would play/watch any game/media with this art style. I’m in love with it. Does anyone know any games/movies with this style??,"Thank you so much! I'm really glad to hear that - I was actually worried at first that I was breaking the style a bit too much for people. I have a couple of projects in this style in the works that aren't quiiiite ready to see the light of day yet - but if you have instagram or twitter I post fanart and my own art like this all the time (and there will definitely be some more Pokemon art coming too).

huh. i guess i always figured that cycling road rose above the water on a sort of land bridge at some point for boats to reach the sea,It is LOL.,pokemon

I was frustated beacause tha vacation was about to end and we were still stuck, but he decided to gift me the game so i could play on my own ds. A week or so later, i finally beat her.

"Why are those 3 the starters chosen again? I heard it has to do with them being a general, a samurai, and an archer, has this been confirmed?",Seems a stretch for Typhlosion to be a general,pokemon
"I miss cyndaquil’s original shiny. Why did they have to change it, the purple flames and black back would look so cool in 3d. But instead we just have brown, which was actually the original non-shiny. Why did they do the cyndaquil line like this. First the shiny, then power creep making it irrelevant (not that it was relevant before), then taking away the flames. I just hope that the cyndaquil line gets some much needed buffs in the new game or it won’t be able to compete at all with the others in pvp.","Same with Charizard for me. 

I love purple shinies and charizard would’ve been great, IMO. The black is still cool",pokemon
Its justt dumb that none of the starters in Legends Arceus are from the Sinnoh,I think it’s great that they are finally mixing up the starters! It takes place in Sinnoh but a very long time ago era.

 Venusaur got those sweet chlorophyll gains,"But it isn't a cool dragon or a turtle with massive guns, just a plant.",pokemon
Also helps that picking Bulbasaur as your starter means an easier time for the first three gyms.,"picking venusaur as a starter helps a LOT, a lv 36 pokemon from the start? nothing has a chance",pokemon
"Call me stubborn but I always chose Squirtle and since then, I always choose Water as they've become my fav. I mean, all of the Pokemons are super cool but I have hydrophobia and I am afraid of crocodiles. Pokemon made me love Water and Feraligatr/ Totodile is my fav Pokemon. I even have a pet Turtle to this day and she loves me a lot. Haha.","I always just picked what ever one I liked the look of most.

Which ended up being Bulbasaur, Cyndaquil, Mudkip, Piplup, Oshawatt, Froakie, Rowlett/Litten and Scorbunny.

Picking one in Pokemon Legends is going to be tough. :(",pokemon
But which one was their special stat in gen 1?,"Both Charizard and Blastoise had 85 special, while Venusaur had 100",pokemon

"We've needed a Ghost/Rock Pokemon for a long time, and this is a great one. Love the zombified look.","Thanks!

I took a lot of inspiration from the way the Duskull line's eyes are drawn, as well as Dhelmise for how to handle moss, and the zombie look just kinda came together off of that.",pokemon
"Rada-rada, rada-radarada rada.",YES! I was thinking the exact thing too. Lol,pokemon
"I like the tombstone vibe. And it gives off a bit of ""sassy"" vibe. Good work.","Yes because tombstones are more psychic than ghost, right? The concept and art are awesome but it should be Ghost not psychic...",pokemon
"It’s a tragedy we don’t have a good gravestone based Ghost/Rock Pokémon, just like how we don’t have a hot pepper based Grass/Fire mon.","> we don’t have a hot pepper based Grass/Fire mon.

You mean a final evolution for the sunkern line",pokemon
It needs like a stronger version of Rock Tomb as its signature move.. Stone Tomb.,"Or maybe ""Entomb"" - Works the same as bind, but is rock type. And instead of fixed damage, it deals damage based on type effectiveness. (e.g. 1/32 hp damage to pokemon which resist rock, 1/16 to neutral, 1/8 to types weak to rock, and 1/4 to Charizard/Moltres/Volcorana/etc.)",pokemon
"Its evolution should be Doomstone. Like ""Gloom and Doom""","My idea is that if I ever do more of his evo line, it'd be more like the Hitmons, with a branching path. My idea for the alt evo was in fact Doomstone.",pokemon
"The crosses wouldn't fly, but the rest of this looks like it's straight from a game. Good job","~~those are actually plusses, it is a math pokemon~~

Gen 5 remakes when?,"*looks at BDSP*

You sure?",pokemon
"I don't get why people love gen 5 so much, it was the worst generation I have played imo.","I think it depends. B&W2 was better than B&W. However I still never got into the gen.

I doubt the pokemon company has this much creativity but hopefully it will be something like this.,"I was just about to post this as well.

"It looks amazing! 😍😍😍
You even put the characters in a way that match the place where you meet them. 
Too bad Maylene is the only gym leader missing. 😬

Edit: She is not missing! She is playing in the snow. I just expected her to be at the right side near Veilstone City. Well done, capturing her friendship with Candice. :D",Great observation! I was hoping someone would notice :p (And yes Maylene and Candice’s friendship is cute <3),pokemon
I Don't know why but i find this very Comforting. it's some Beautiful Art Great Job,"I always feel that way when I’m playing Platinum, so I’m really glad to hear that got through in this painting 😌",pokemon
"Bro, this aged well. Super cool! Dialga and Palkia look super cute, I think they're knitting?","Yup! Bit of a whacky concept but I wanted to portray them creating (“weaving”) the region out of nothing, which everyone lives happily on while being oblivious to the nothingness beyond the world they live in (shit this actually sounds morbid when I type it out lol)",pokemon

I saw the link to buy a poster. Is there by chance a way to support you while putting the image on a wall scroll or fabric poster? Going with the fabric theme it seems too perfect.,Wait what? There’s a link to buy a poster? Where o_0 ?,pokemon
Am I the only one here who’s not that upset about the new art style?,"I mean...it’s not really the style itself I think. The characters from the trailer just seemed kind of sloppily rendered and out of scale (the proportions looked weird to me, like the head is way too big even for chibi). I really hope they polish it more, as the smol style can potentially turn out really cute imo if done right.",pokemon
The prophecy has come...,"Not even kidding, I was legit taking inspiration from animal crossing when I drew this, and look what we’ve got now omg",pokemon
This is amazing. Seriously!!,Thank youuu 😊,pokemon

"Did anyone else never hear the word “chibi” before last Friday? Like... I’ve played Pokémon and video games and watched anime my whole life... How did I miss “chibi”? Aren’t I a certified weeb? 

Everyone out here saying “chibi” like it’s a common adjective. WAT?","If you've ""watched anime my whole life"" I'm guessing you missed Sailor Moon, and her daughter Sailor Chibi Moon. That's where I first heard it. But also when an art style suddenly changes to a chibi style in the middle of a scene, that's common in some anime.",pokemon
It aged like fine wine my dude. Beautiful!,Thank you!,pokemon
I think you've mistaken with not aged well cuz if anything it aged like a fine wine!,"Aw man thanks dude, that’s really nice of you to say 😊",pokemon
"*@lelepoppipie draws chibi art*

Pokemon Company: Write that down!","Oh shit so this is my fault (j/k lol I actually don’t mind the smolness too much, with some polishing it could look cute)",pokemon

"Reddit then universally decides to blame you for the new games...

Jk it looks really cool!","Lmao

((Thanks btw! :p))",pokemon
"i love this so much!! each of the characters are so expressive and it was fun to look for all of them. my faves are rowan side eyeing lucas, fantina being fantina, and flint trying to cheer volkner up. (and the more i look at it the more i find to love, i didn’t notice cheryl in the corner or that dialga and palkia are stitching!)",Aww thank you!

"I absolutely love how Dialga and Palkia are knitting away at the world, and Giratina is.. Doing its best. Made me smile!",“Doing it’s best” lol I like that!,pokemon

You are so skilled! What an awesome concept; you executed it perfectly! I love Dialga and Palkia weaving the region.,Thank you!! I’m especially glad you like the concept :p Was thinking it’d come off as weird oop-,pokemon
"You monster. I love it. It kind of makes me feel better about the remakes, too.",Aww really? I’m so happy to hear that 💙 this sub can use a little more positivity sometimes,pokemon
That's terrific. Reminds me of Earthbound.,Hearing it looks like Earthbound is all the praise I need.,pokemon

I say u predicted the future and it aged perfectly. Fine work my friend.,I’m glad to hear this 😌 thanks!,pokemon
Love this! Is it watercolour and ink pen? Would love to replicate those textures myself,It’s watercolor!,pokemon
"Damn, your chibis look better. They don’t have any freaky fingers. Good job! I also like how Dialga and Palkia are weaving the region together, I assume it’s a reference to the “fabric” of space-time?","I honestly think the characters would look much better if their hands didn’t look so huge.

Thanks btw! (And yes, it is :pp)",pokemon
"I always find it sad that people forget the elite four, Aaron and Bertha, such nice characters but other than that this incredible art, might use it as my background",Aww man don’t get me wrong I like these guys too (kinda underrated imo) If I could fit them in there I would’ve :’),pokemon
I like how Dialga has the yarn around his stumps like “what am I supposed to do with these” while Palkia is going at it.,Lol I love this XD For some reason I always pictured Dialga as an oaf,pokemon
"Really cool poster. 

It shows that a Chibi style is perfectly fine. I think there's just something off about the Remakes imo.",It’s the handsss (otherwise it’ll look something like animal crossing imo -after some refining),pokemon
I *wish* this is what the DP remakes ended up looking like. The art style they’ve chosen looks garbage in comparison.,"The art style is fine, as another user pointed out, the reason it looks so weird is that the game models are missing an outline. If you think about it, this is exactly what was done in the originals. Small, almost chibi like, pixels. But if you dont like it, thats not my place to judge. People have different opinions, i just hope that you have fun with any of the new games coming out",pokemon
"I am just so impressed by this beautiful work of art. You have captured so much in this image. There’s a wild and wonderful juxtaposition between cotton candy cute and the unease of infinite universal chaos. I caught myself looking at the details of EVERYTHING! The little signs at the cave, the grass, the ground under the trio, there’s just so many wonderful details here, thank you so much! I am excited for the art style, albeit it practical in my expectations, and your masterpiece made me even more pumped!  

Edit: had a mini stroke in the middle of a sentence there.","Dang dude thank you so much for this awesome elaborate comment. It really made my day to read all this (or night, where I live haha)",pokemon
I do not like the chibi style they went with for the Gen 4 remakes but HOLY SHIT this is fucking amazing. It's not just really cute and comfy to look at but the amount of little details you put (Volkner being depressed lol) is outstanding. Congrats I suspect a lot of people are going to download this.,"Thanks dudee, it really warms my heart when someone notices details like that. 

And damn lol, I was seriously expecting people to poke fun at this because it’s literally the same. Idea. As the remakes lmao (but now I’m glad y’all didn’t, I seriously appreciate all the kind words here)",pokemon
Is this your primary art account? Because you deserve a follow after this. Also is this a cropped version or is there a full image version of this?,"Yup I guess it is now lol. As for the second question, this is slightly cropped at the edges to avoid white lines but is otherwise as full an image as it can get.",pokemon
You. Why would you prophesize this?,Well...🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️  xp,pokemon
"Ahh, so it's *your* fault!

Kidding, of course. <3 Your artwork is very cute! That's such a crazy coincidence, though. :D",I knowwww I’m still shooked about it hahaha,pokemon

"Honestly, I'm really miffed by all the people complaining about the art style. I like it. I think it's cute. And let's all remember that this is a game aimed at ***CHILDREN***. Like, yeah, the adult audience is here too but let's not act like it's their job to solely please us jaded 20- or 30-somethings.

Your poster aged quite well, imo. It's adorable and honestly, if I had spending money I would probably buy it of I saw it in a store.","Thanks! And yeah I see what you mean. Tbh it’s not that I really have an issue with the style (as I said in another comment it could turn out really cute), just that I hope they’ll refine it more (which I’m pretty sure they will) What we saw in the trailer seems like a beta version and I guess that’s what irked some people",pokemon

You could always draw the scene a second time and then compare your presence level of skill with how you were back then to see how far you've grown,It is really good just as a piece all on its own regardless of how well you think you're drawing skills should be.

"Not related but...

I actually find an interesting fact about the move Chatter

Actually, Chatot is not the only Pokemon who can use Chatter. However, I don't know if this ""Pokemon"" really counts cause

1. That second ""Pokemon"" that can use it is  F-00. In the Pokestar Studio only in the ""An Everlasting Memory"" serie, and I don't know if that even counts as a Pokemon

2. F-00 can only use Chatter in ONE MOVIE ONLY. Not the whole serie, just the first movie. 

I find that interesting that there are lots of unique typings and Signature Moves only one Pokemon can use that can be seen and used by the fakemon in Pokestar Studio. Maybe you should cover it next time",That's pretty interesting.,pokemon
"To quote Bulbapedia's [Snarl page, which has a legit way of using the move in BW:](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Snarl_(move))

>Thus the only way for the move to be generally obtained at that time was to receive the event Zoroark listed above, then pass down the move via breeding, chain breeding, or Sketch, taking advantage of the fact that TM moves can be passed down. Outside of Volt Tackle, this was the only case where a move that is not an Egg Move required breeding to obtain.

So basically speaking, even if you don't have the TM for it, you can still have the move and pass it down with the requirements above. However, because this method is now defunct and the event Zoroark now ages old, this move, along with Freeze Shock and Ice Burn, are the only (?) moves in ~~Generation 5~~ Black and White where no Pokémon can learn them.","Wait, is Freeze Shock and Ice Burn actually in BW? I thought they were newly introduced in B2W2",pokemon
"Random thought I just had: Statistically speaking, Hustle is actually better than Iron Fist. Hustle boosts all physical moves' powers by 1.5x, but drops their accuracy to 0.8x. This means that on average, Hustle boosts all physical moves' powers by 1.2x (1.5 x 0.8 = 1.2) Iron Fist on the other hand boosts punching moves' powers by 1.2x, and all punching moves are physical. So Hustle does all of Iron Fists' job and more.

For some reason this just seems so strange to me, though there could be something I overlooked","If Pokemon was a game where you just attacked a wall with 1 million HP you would be correct. The difference is that it doesn't matter how much damage you deal, as long as you deal enough to knockout you opponent.

For example, imagine a team of 6 Pokemon who have 1 HP and are slower than you. If you had iron fist and your move had 100% accuracy you can knock all of them out without taking a hit. If you have hustle so your move has 80% accuracy you will take, on average, 1 hit per battle.",pokemon
so u had to buy HGSS for a TM in BW????,"Yup, if the event had been released. Wasn't even that good of a TM.

It was part of a group of distributions for HGSS that cross-promoted BW and the Zoroark movie. The others were all Pokemon - a Celebi and shiny versions of Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. Transferring them to BW was the only way to get Zorua and Zoroark; you couldn't get them in normal gameplay until B2W2.",pokemon
Very good drawing. Torterra is my go-to!,Thx torterra is amazing too,pokemon
Empoleon!,Empoleon is awesome :),pokemon
"It’s so obviously Infernape. Torterra is a worse Venusaur, and Empolen is, well, just look at it.","Lol, infernape for the win",pokemon
"Wow, I had no idea that scalping had gotten that bad. I thought it was only happening for expensive items, like consoles and new game releases. I will pick up a booster pack every once in a while just for fun, and I've never had an issue buying cards at stores in the past few years.","Same. I would always just buy the occasional booster pack when I was feeling down and next thing I know Pokémon became the most popular thing in the world, but yeah at every store in my city it’s virtually impossible to find any Pokémon product.",pokemon
I agree with you I'm 13 and in my life I've only opened 5 packs because when ever I want them there always out of stock or the lines are too long. I dont want yo buy them from online because there far to expensive and some of them are even fake.,"That’s awful. I wish things were different, maybe try and go to target early in the morning on tuesdays and thursdays, in my city there’s always a giant line of people waiting to buy packs.",pokemon
I feel Legends Acreus is going to be a huge seller on the Switch. I think it could exceed Sword and Shield.,"It has promise, but is still far off.  Just because it looks like BotW, doesn't mean it plays good.  Especially when the game play looks the same as any other pokemon game.  I would think legends could also have pokemon snap style game play mixed in, since BotW has its own compendium of picture taking that was fun for collection.  Pokedex = Sheika Slate? It really goes to say that legends could drop the ball and feel like a tedious PoS though.  They need to show more... but they have time.",pokemon
Oshawott crew rise up!,OSHAWOTT all the wayyyyyy,pokemon
If we have acces to home in that game im getting all three,All three of them are fantastic. Maybe my favorites of their generations.,pokemon
"This is very difficult for me. I love all 3. Usually I like 1 more than the others but here... idk I may choose Rowlett but let’s be honest.... ill probs choose the cyndaquil

Regional forms?","Would love regional forms, or megas",pokemon
honestly i will never understand why people pick cyndaquil. Quilava is just big cyndaquil. And Typhlosion is just big quilava,So what you are saying is if a Pokemon evolves into a bigger version of itself it isn’t interesting?,pokemon
that's almost the truth,"He’s all I see. Even in memes contemplating between two, he’s the common denominator.

He is Supreme",pokemon

could you draw a flygon please? i love all of these,No Problem! Ill get on it right now! Ill reply with the link when its done,pokemon
Followed by complaining for getting what they had been asking for,"if it's not executed well, it makes sense why someone would complain...",pokemon
No that wouldn’t make sense because there is a space in between the arm and torso,That’s the thing. Palkia’s arms are like mini portals cuz Palkia manipulates space.,pokemon
"I love it, but he looks like he has a dirty secret.",[https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/lx2dwu/turtwig/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/lx2dwu/turtwig/) that's all I have to say,pokemon
I feel like people compare Legends to BOTW is because BOTW is the most know open-world game. Also the shot in the trailer that showed the world initially is very reminiscent of the similar cutscene in BOTW.,"Also, I feel like if Pokémon legends has an open world even remotely as explorable and rich as BOTW, it’s gonna be an amazing game and people are probably just excited at the thought of a game like that. I’ve wanted a Pokémon game like that ever since I was a kid",pokemon
"People aren't saying it in a bad way. That's the closest thing we can compare it to. I've never played BOTW and even I jumped to that after seeing the trailer. Botw os a good game its not a bad thing to compare it.

I guess better comparison would be to colosseum, xd gale of darkness but those werent really that open-world.","Well, I have seen a couple of people say is Pokemon legends looks bad simply because it doesn't look as good as BOTW.",pokemon
ok i'll stop bc you asked.,"Thanks bro

😎🤝😎",pokemon
"Ah yes. More swords, but this time something I want.",since there are so many sword fighters in smash why not just add a literal fuckin sword at this point,pokemon
Sakurai: We know that you are tired of anime sword fighters so how about just the sword this time.,"That'd make for a hilarious reveal trailer - Pyra, the FE roster, and a few others exchanging self-aware/critical dialogue only for Aegislash to show up",pokemon
How... the hair....,Superglue. They found the girl that started the gofundme,pokemon

"I support this, and will pray to my gods that this will be a future mega evolution.",Join Shuckle Hydra! we have cake,pokemon
It's disturbing,Lol,pokemon
I want a Shuckle evolution. They could do a regional Shuckle with an evolution added (Galar style) to get around the Eviolite problem.,That would be cool,pokemon

Yeah the BDSP remakes went a whole different approach of trying to achieve nostalgia. Also I knew something was missing out of the photo. The SWSH sprite isnt on the timeline.,ORAS isn't in there either yet they made sure to add Diamond/Pearl PLUS HeartGold/SoulSilver. Then just Black 2/White 2 instead of Black and White with it and also didn't add Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee.,pokemon
I'm personally attached to gen 6.,"Yeah honestly, the leap to 3d was weird for dungeons and etc, but the overworld remained cute, and slightly chibi. Was a nice aesthetic, it just had a lot to live up to.",pokemon
Except Sw/Sh ?,Also ORAS and LGPE,pokemon
Is it weird that I like Gen 6 the most?,You are not alone. Also loved the introduction of the roller blades,pokemon
"They all look 10x better than smol Dawn. Its not just the Chibi style, its the awful t-pose arms, its the clunky giant feet + no knees. It looks even worse in an HD 3D environment. 

I still don't get why they didn't just use Let's Go Pikachu & Eevee engine, when it was a perfect balance between modern HD graphics + a more cartoony style.","Exactly. Such a shame because gen 4 is definitely up there as one of the best stories/regions and introduced some of the best pokemon and now newer players aren’t going to be able to appreciate the games because they won’t be able to look past the art style, and the Arceus game whilst super exciting isn’t going to showcase sinnoh in its traditional state so they will continue to be overlooked unfortunately by newer players who will prefer the more mediocre  regions and stories.",pokemon
"Gen 7 feels so underrated. I loved how Sun/Moon introduced both realistic proportions for characters and the organic terrains for the region's design.

Gen 7 games were great!","Gen 7’s character designs were great, but the terrain itself felt so linear.",pokemon
For some reason I like the black and white look the best,BW and SM really pushed their console limit,pokemon
"I feel like when I imagine what a Pokemon game looks like, I think of Gen 3 every time.",Same but with HGSS,pokemon
"Pokemon.  The franchise that just refuses to evolve, just like their mascot",Legends Arceus is the step in the right direction,pokemon
I like the dp remakes art style a lot tbh stays faithful but its updated. Like yall do realize all the games used to be chibi like that?,does not mean we have to go back and throw out all the progress? Also sprite chibi >>> 3D chibi,pokemon

I seriously want them to bring back the following Pokemon from HG/SS. I miss being able to wander into a Pokemon Center with a Wailord trailing behind me.,"Lol
I swear i remember the game forcing you to return your pokemon if it was too big.",pokemon
"I don’t understand how following Pokémon isn’t in every game now. It’s like you KNOW we want this, gamefreak! It’s not even up for debate anymore. For anyone that doesn’t want this feature brought back, comment and explain why, because I feel like we’re all on the same page on this one.","This is one of the features I want back, but would also accept being limited to some pokemon.

I dont see the point of buying it if it's the EXACT same game 1:1 as DP. Just bust out your old DS and start playing what everyone else is paying 60 bucks for. At least OR/AS provided other things to be excited about....,"see, am hoping they are making the remakes more akin to soul silver and heart gold, where you can get almost all legendaries in 1 game. also the fact that endgame was more flushed out.",pokemon
I'd be surprised if either show up. I also don't see mega evolutions making a return in BD/SP,Megas are very likely to return. If they don't then the fact that they are selling mega lucario and mega charizard x merch as part of the BDSP merch cycle will make little sense.,pokemon
Following Pokémon will probably return in Amity Park if anything.,"Bullshit, I want it everywhere",pokemon

"I have a feeling this game is gonna remind me of the pace of ""Hey you Pikachu!"" While introducing some amazing mechanics.

Compete Kyurem NEEDS to happen.,I'm kinda' shocked that it never happened.,pokemon
"Would that really work as well? ""Unexplored America"" sounds like it could present some... problems... to say the least. I'd be up for an open world Unova game alongside B/W, but unlike Sinnoh, the region's real life based history might not provide as much to work with, unless you're playing as either colonizers or natives or something.","Well thankfully the Pokemon Universe is not tied down to world history.

For example:

We already know Unova used to be a kingdom, with a monarch residing within it. No such thing ever occurred in North America.

They can do whatever they want with Unova's history.",pokemon

"I want to see wild Pokemon interact with each other. Playing, fighting, scaring others away, consuming each other (OK maybe not that one). Really want Pokemon to also react to the players actions.

"I like the idea of a hard-AI mode, where the campaign battles are closer in difficulty to post-game battle facilities, and the switch-on-opponent-faint choice is not provided.

I'd prefer to leave the experience share on, though. Increased grinding doesn't make the game harder, just more tedious.","I hear you on all of this. For me, the grind is what made the early games that much harder and more rewarding. If no ‘Hero Mode’, I just hope it’s an option to turn Exp Share off. After I’m through the main storyline, however, I’m all in on turning it back on.",pokemon
"I would love to see a master mode or hero mode difficulty setting, but I would go further than that. Change the AI to have better Pokemon (eg perfect IV's, competitive EV's, competitive sets, strong items etc) while restricting players more until the post-game (they can't obtain powerful items for example).",This would be awesome.

"Yes, the most inclusive dex is the one considered, which means Pt, B2W2, and USUM dexes. I don't see why IoA and CT dexes would not be considered part of the Galar dex. Does that means Galarian Slowpoke isn't native to Galar?","SwSh make this a bit weird.

The game has three Pokédexes with DLC, labeled ""Pokédex"", ""Isle of Armor Pokédex"" and ""Crown Tundra"" Pokédex. There's no ""master dex"" like Alola (and Kalos?) had. Because of this most people consider the first one the Galar dex, not the combination of the three. You get the certificate for completion for all three, and the shiny charm for the first one.

Galarian Slowpoke in this sense isn't native to mainland Galar, but just the Isle of Armor, which is part of Galar.

Ultimately though the game leaves this open for discussion, and your choice to include IoA and CT is fine imho :)",pokemon
It explains in part why the Zubat line is so beloved. Funny how that doesn’t apply at all to Psyduck line though,I mean I’ve never heard anyone say they don’t like the psyduck line,pokemon

I frankly love the BD/SP graphics as we've seen them. I wish they had gone with that for the games since S/M.,"Yeah I can say I think BDSP will be the the best 3D games, being faithful remakes of already great games. And it provides a super creative art style translating the 2D chibi to 3D chibi.",pokemon
"I do agree that the 2D style of the older games where it's that more bird's eye perspective does seem to suit the series better, personally though I'd opt for what Gen IV and V did where you have 2D Sprites with 3D environments.

However the series really would need a distinctive artstyle to justify staying in 2D, personally I think it'd be cool to opt for a style that brings the series to looking more like the earlier Ken Sugimori style with that high presence of washed out shading and the more angular character designs.","Ngl I didn’t make the distinction in my brain that gens 4 and 5 had 2D sprites with 3D environments before this but it makes sense.

"Someone mentioned this, but I think there's some fuzzy logic in Pokémon canon about Pokémon 'choosing' the trainer. There's some level of consent involved. In the messed-up world of Poke-logic, if you beat-up a Pokémon real bad, they'll respect your strength as a trainer and might ""agree"" on some level to let a Pokeball capture them. If the Pokémon is totally unconscious, that level of acceptance  can't occur.  


Pokémon logic is weird sometimes.","Master Ball engineers: ""I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.""",pokemon
"I always thought it was like consent, you can’t give consent to being captured if you’re unconscious.",I guess then Goh has been kidnapping all them pokemon so far.,pokemon

"There are going to be people who take it way too seriously and say everything has to be perfect, and then there’s going to people who say the shortcomings or undesired outcome is supposed to be treated like a gift from god.

The last can’t handle those changes. Thenthere are people who fully understand that they can still love Pokémon and have criticisms, and people who have criticisms, but still love the games. This shouldn’t be so hard to understand, but here we are, acting like babies for some, and others not even getting involved at all, and others potentially overreacting or under reacting. In short, we have something to say about anything related to Pokémon, the best choice is to give everyone a bit of what they want. You would like a game to have a contest, but not centered on contests? Seems reasonable. Want the battle frontier? Reasonable. Want better quality for the game in regards to how strong the Switch is compared to the 3ds? That’s reasonable. Want every region put into one game? Most likely never gonna happen. Want everything everyone wants in the game? That probably won’t be possible with EVERYTHING everyone wants, but putting enough big and small things with quality and care into the games will most likely satisfy a big majority us while the minority can still have fun playing the games, cards, making art, or enjoy merchandise or previous games. There’s something everyone likes and wants, and I respect that as much as I expect other people to do the same and respect my wants, likes, and dislikes of anything related to Pokémon in a calm discussion or argument where we may have separate opinions, but we don’t need to kill each other for that",I-,pokemon

"Most of this goes way over my head, but I am definitely interested in the end result of finding a team that counterbalances anything I might run into as much as possible.  It's basically how I build my teams already just not quite so scientifically.

Like, I try to never have a type overlap on my team, to broaden the number of types I'm carrying thus giving me a better chance to have something to offset the enemy.  I am also a full frontal assault trainer, I recognize the value of stat changers, battlefield effects and other such things, but my mon's are all about damage.  I also make sure that with dual typing my mon's have at least one move for each type, and ideally one move that is off-type that may counter something they are weak to (if they can learn it)

I feel like I've done pretty well using rules like this, and it's especially nice because it encourages me not to just use all of my favorites all the time.  It makes me wonder what kind of answers the program might come up with if I were to supply two 'mons from my various past teams to it.","Thats basically how I've been playing until now, just wanted to see how much my team could be improved upon. Let me know if u want me to complete your team :)

For example, I was thinking about something like

    Swampert Breloom Crobat Aggron Magnezone Gardevoir

as a team, but the program values that pretty low at -0.81, as Garchomp does very well against it. I assumed having a fairy was good vs it, but Garchomp has higher initative and will destroy Gardevoir with earthquake due to the high attack vs. abysmal defence pairing.",pokemon

"What we need is a game disconnected from legendary pokemon.

Legendary pokemon should *not* be the central theme to a pokemon game. They should be incidental; like the first game.

Also, the next pokemon game should allow the player to choose his age and background as the audience has aged with the games. (I'm 40 now and remember playing red/blue fondly as new games I knew nothing about; the internet being in its infancy)

The main character should not be taking down any huge organizations or thwarting any world-ending super events.","Exactly!! We need the Legendaries to be mysterious and have minimal lore in the main story so that when we stumble onto them it’s meaningful and intriguing. Being able to set the player’s background would also be interesting as it would let players have a more tailored experience to them and would make the game feel more like an RPG without adding in major RPG elements like what can be seen in Fallout and Elder Scrolls. While having an evil corporation like Team Rocket and the player bringing them down isn’t realistic, it works as a strictly power-fantasy element and could be kept in but just scaled back so it’s not the main driving force behind the story. Legendary Pokémon have lost meaning since they were pushed to the forefront of the story since Gen 3 (even a little in Gen 2) so having a game not focusing on them would be refreshing",pokemon

The chibi just gives me an unsettling feeling. Like they look kinda like lumps of clay ? Idk I love the idea of it but the chibi is meh,It’s the ultra chibi body but then the detailed hands... makes it look Frankensteinwd together,pokemon
I'm backwards. I like the art style but am nervous otherwise.,"Ditto.  I'm sitting here asking myself if there's going to be any new content to justify the $60 price tag or is it going to be an almost exact copy of D/P.

Then I start asking myself what features might get removed, like the Poke Plaza, Battle Frontier, Amity Park, or Safari Zone, just to bump up a release date.

I'm just waiting for a release of an image of a Shining Palkia or something to get me hopeful.",pokemon
"I feel like I might be alone on this one:

I’m not so much angry at the art style itself. I mean it’s essentially the same thing Nintendo did with links awakening so it’s really no all that bad.

What irks me about it is I can’t help but feel this art direction was chosen specifically so gamefreak could get away with low quality to non existent animation again, which most people called them out for in Sword and Shield.

It feels lazy, but only because sword and shield exist and how gamefreak handled the whole thing with lies and general incompetence.",">What irks me about it is I can’t help but feel this art direction was chosen specifically so gamefreak could get away with low quality to non existent animation again, which most people called them out for in Sword and Shield.

How dare you say this. Game freak would never do that. They love us. They obviously tried their hardest to make this game as perfect as possible 😡😡😡😡😡",pokemon
I dont care about the art im more upset that it doesn't look like it is adding anything... Every remake back to fire red and leaf green added something new to the games but these look like a 1to1 remake.,"""No no you see that makes it *faithful.""*",pokemon
I'm just happy that they're remaking the games and it's better than no remake,Idk man no remake would give them more time to make the eventually announced remake better.,pokemon
"my opinion on the art style (when it comes to the character designs) is that.. they should've stuck to sprites or changed it, it just looks weird which is how I feel about adapting art styles that are made out of necessity due to hardware limitations, I don't like how Link's Awakening on Switch looks either since they took an art style that was made for the GameBoy & GameBoy Color and just made it 3d instead of changing the art style to something resembling how the game would've looked if they weren't limited by the gameboy's hardware (refer to the cutscenes of Link's Awakening on GameBoy and the artwork for Link's awakening to understand what I mean).","- Well said, I agree entirely. Over the yrs, I personally restricted myself to playing  
DPP (I went from Red>Gold>HG>B2>X/Y>OR>USUM) in hopes of potentially experiencing an unvisited region  w updated/modern graphics but after seeing the trailer, I just felt let down. 
-   GF had a ""graphical"" formula that was working w. their remakes and now we come to this Gen and they suddenly drop it? It's just illogical to me.
- I understand going back to top/down format but to downgrade the overworld character models to this extent is just unsettling. (Oh man, that dreaded waddle) 

In time I'll probably overlook their art choices and focus on game play, but I just feel GF and their associates could've done much much more.",pokemon
"I don’t even care about the art style, Platinum was the first ever Pokémon game I owned and I cannot describe how happy/excited I am to go back to Sinnoh.",I mean it was bound to happen since it's a safe project. So you shouldn't feel some form of gratefulness that they decided to make it. They clearly cut corners making the remake compared to previous remakes that are to the same technical standards as their current-gen counterparts. Imagine if heart gold and soul silver came out and it had GBA graphics.,pokemon

Only thing i care about is having the entire national dex up to sinnoh obtainable.,"Honestly I want the rest of it too. Every other remake managed it and there's literally no reason they can't here besides choosing to withhold it considering they patched bits of it into SwSh after the fact. And if there's some bullshit excuse about not having time to do it they should use the Sword/Shield execution as a copyable framework to base future stuff on.

Of course futureproofing during X and Y did fuck all for Sw/Sh apparently so who knows what excuse they'll shit out next to cut corners.",pokemon
"i really have no problems with the overworld stuff, its just what we were playing gens 1-5 but now the overworld is so high quality the sprites being so chibi is off putting to some. i think its called the uncanny valley or something now that its not pixels we are looking at.","It absolutely is the uncanny valley effect for me and I think most people. But it is also the fact that before, you knew the sprite wasn’t chibi but rather shrunk down due to tech limitations and the viewpoint made the head a bit bigger and the head was more important to see. Now they have the tech to have more realistic sprites even if they were shrunken but they went full chibi. I think that plays a big factor for many people.",pokemon

Guess there can be no inbetween,There can definitely be an inbetween.  But for the sake of this poll I wanted to know if given no choice do more people dislike dynamax or love it?,pokemon
"Im between it, but I did really like dynamax adventures so I voted love",I like dynamax adventures a lot.  But as a battle mechanic in ranked singles and doubles I really hated dynamax.,pokemon
"Love and hate are strong words.


I enjoy Dynamax.


I love Mega Evolution.",You love mega evolution more right?  I suppose on this poll that would = I hate dynamax option.,pokemon
"I like the idea. I think that G-Max is awesome and some of the forms are really cool. However, mechanically, the concept sucks. Especially since it’s basically 3 turns of Z-Moves without any item requirement and you’re basically unkillable unless the opponent is Dynamaxed as well. On paper the concept is awesome, but when implemented it falls flat. At least Z-moves had a purpose and could coexist with Mega Evolution. Dynamax can’t coexist with anything, which is likely intentional.",I agree with you 100%,pokemon
Where is the apathy vote? Guess we silent majority.,"I was really trying to see purely whether dynamax was loved or hated.  An ""I don't care"" option would have just watered down the desired results.",pokemon
"I voted hate, but its more accurate to say Im neutral leaning dislike on it",I think most people are in the same camp because they were attached to the mega evolutions.  But I can assure you if you got into competitive battling you'd absolutely hate dynamax.  Turns my defensive wall/stall toxapex who has scald/toxic/baneful bunker/ recover into max geyser and 3 max guards.  This mechanic strengthens only offensive pokemon and completely screws over alternative strategies like defensive walling / stalling / healing builds.  I hope they don't bring it back ever.  Megas as overpowered as they were would be much preferred to dynamax.,pokemon
"Dynamax is washed down mega. Mega changes design plus improve stats and/or changes type, while dynamax just makes it big and almost doubles hp stat. Dynamax makes slight change in design, but still.",I agree with you 100%.  I honestly felt like dynamax was their solution to the time crunch.  They had to rush to make Gen 8 and wanted a mechanic similar to mega evolution but didn't want to make all the custom models and animations and could be compatible with all pokemon.  So we just make the pokemon big and turn their moves into generic big moves.  It's lazy and robs people like me who liked to play stall / defensive / healing builds.  My stalling / healing / poisoning toxapex who has scald/toxic/ baneful bunker/ recover dynamaxes and then has max geyser and 3 max guards.  Like how you gonna take away an entire subset of strategy in a strategy RPG game?,pokemon
The ratio puts a smile on my face,As does it put a smile on my face too friend ;),pokemon
">there has been a lot of talk on whether mega evolution will make a return and or whether they will continue to use Dynamax as the series transformation / power up battle mechanic

I bet neither. BDSP is ""faithful"" to the originals, and I don't see how or why they would put it into Legends. We'll probably get nothing in these games, and once gen 9 rolls around we'll get a completely new gimmick.

Edit: And like everyone else already said, this poll should have ""like"", ""dislike"" and ""neutral"" options. You say this lets you get clear results of whether more people like or hate it, but not really. This is just causing people to vote for something they usually wouldn't or not vote at all, which gives inaccurate results. Even if you only wanted those two options, you should've said ""like"" and ""dislike"", love and hate are strong words.",I agree it makes no sense for it to be in either game.  But the fact that we haven't seen any mega evolution or dynamax in either trailer has caused people to speculate as they do after these kinds of teaser trailers come out.  It is my hope that neither game has any transformation mechanic.  I kinda like regular old school battles.,pokemon

"Yeah, turn based combat is the staple of the Pokémon franchise. I'm not against a real time combat spin off game but if the main ones changed I'd be disappointed. 

Real time combat wouldn't work with the current way Pokémon moves and stats are set up, either. It would become a spamming match, not a strategy game.

Or at least they could give us the option in settings.",But making 2 different combat systems for one game is a bit too much considering the amount of pokemon,pokemon

"Journeys issue, similar to my gripes with SM, is Ash and him not doing anything. If this was just a separate series starring Goh, Chloe and one of the SwSh kids traveling the world, I think the show would have been a fine advertisement for Pokémon Go while Ash, the other SwSh kid and one of the gym leaders could solely feature Galar. 

It hurts to see Ash’s purpose in Journeys basically be a cheerleader to gush about this Pokémon and that Pokémon right before Goh yeets a pokeball at their face. His World Championship tournament goal is hilariously based on coincidences of two entrants being at the same place at the same time and it’s SO irrelevant that we’ve skipped some of his battles, depriving his barely-seen team (sans Lucario) of screen time. 

The season is definitely in need of a unique arc now that the Darkest Day one is finished. And it really should be an Ash one because his goal is the only one with obstacles. Goh currently has no rivals and I’m not sure how he could EVER have one in Pokémon collecting since he’s not aiming for quality catches, just the entries.","Honestly, the shiny hunter guy could have been an interesting rival if they actually tried to flesh him out and didn't just make him a punchline",pokemon
"Honestly I think Journeys is the second worst Pokemon anime series after best Wishes. Ash might have a cool team but his pokemon are barely featured and we almost never see them work as a team unlike in previous animes. The episodes feel short, sketch-like, and very disconected from each other. There’s too many bad filler episodes and Goh...I’m sorry but he’s an awful character, he’s uninteresting, predictable and annoying and he just does not give a damn about his pokemon besides Cinderace. It lacks real substance and an actual solid plot. The beginning was good but after 20 or so episodes the show just...got really bad. Team rocket doesn’t even seem to care much about Pikachu and they were made even dumber than before for no reason.","Also,speaking of team rocket...Every time there winning.The animators or the people who direct the show seem to not know how the main caracters are gonna win.So they keep making events that are one in a million.For example there is that one episode where team rocket gets a lugia ballon to get near ash and go.Then they capture the pokemons and what do you know.Out of nowhere a mew disguised as a lugia appears to help them.",pokemon

Gen III was *hated* back in the day for this very reason.

"Those first 4 never had original overworld sprites in the base game, and there are 14 more who will most likely receive their own based on this. The last one is most likely just a reskin of the other kid holding a DS in Jubilife city, still a nice touch. I think this adds variety and gives a little immersion. Hopefully this means there will be more immersive features in these remakes (maybe a weather system, seasons cycle, or a more advanced day and night cycle?(which it kinda looks like we’re getting from the trailer)).","The day/night cycle might explain why the lighting looks inconsistent across the clips we saw in the preview!

"Lol wow this post really showed me how much better Chibi looks in 2D than 3D. Wonder why? Maybe 2D leaves room for imagination, whereas 3D is too detailed and falls into the uncanny valley? Just a guess","2D leaving room for imagination is exactly why I think the 2D games look better than BDSP, and also why the battles look better in 2D as opposed to 3D (in the main series' animation style). In 2D, a sprite is a representation of something, and you're allowed to use your imagination a little. Everyone interprets the sprites a little differently, despite seeing the same thing. In 3D, however, you're being directly shown something, and there's not any room to go ""oh, I saw X whereas my friend thinks Y instead"" - what you see is what you get. It's the same thing with how the battle animation style is. (disclaimer: I'm not talking about Hyper Beam or the other special attacks that have a ton of care put into them in Gen 8, I'm talking about the more general moves.) In the 2D games, they couldn't animate the Pokémon doing each attack, as the sprites would take up an insane amount of space on the cartridge, and it would also be a massive undertaking. Instead, you're shown two Pokémon and an attack animation, and your brain automatically goes ""oh, okay, my Pokémon hopping a bit and a foot striking the enemy represents it kicking them"". But in 3D, because you're seeing what is supposed to be a direct representation rather than a more general/ambiguous one, it looks much worse to have the same thing but with 3D models (example: that one clip of Scorbunny's Double Kick in SWSH that everyone got all up in arms about). 

I'm not 100% sure that I expressed my feelings as clearly as I could have, but people going ""it's faithful to the originals"" have been bothering me because I love the original spritework, but do not think a 1:1 translation into 3D looks good and I feel that there are many better ways to go about having chibi models (if they were going to do it at all), like how ORAS or LGPE handled it.",pokemon
2D sprites usually don’t look great when translated 1:1 to 3D. Simple is that. You’re not pointing out a hypocrisy in BDSP critics.,"What about when Mario and Link went 3D. Like I get it people have a bunch of nostalgia for 2D sprites, but I think they honestly are an evolution. Link’s Awakening Remake did the exact same as this remake, and people love that game. I’m just confused on what makes this so different?",pokemon
"Just because something worked as a 2D sprite that needed to fit within the limitations of single squares on a level grid does NOT mean it translates or should be utilized in 3D. We're in the 8th generation of Pokemon and these visuals are stuck in a weird limbo of faithfulness and modernity and what we're left with is an uglier version of a game that came out over a decade ago. 

Pokemon fans will give a free pass to anything that brand farts their way and adamantly shut down any discourse that suggests they can and should elevate their standards. Remakes peaked with HGSS and have trended downward since and fans will gleefully continue to pardon and reward less effort. Unreal.

Skipping these and hopefully Arceus continues to show promise.","Or some of us just enjoy the style as a fun way to recreate the style of the original games in a modern style...

I mean personally, and I can't speak for everyone of course, but I actually think the remakes look better visually than the older games. 

So I don't think it's people just giving it a free pass, I think it's just others like me who actually kind of dig it.",pokemon
"Not here to argue with anyone but I just feel like the animation they chose this go around with BDSP was a step back from Gen 7 and Gen 8. And it really looks like a 1:1 remake, was hoping for a fresh new take of Sinnoh and something closer to the Gen 8 engine 

Pokémon Arceus looks amazing but it’s a single player game. Which means no battling and trading online or with your friends 

I also don’t think any of these games will have a complete national dex which means my gang from Shield won’t make into any of these new games. I was looking forward to adding on to my team too but don’t won’t happen most likely","I agree especially with the first bit. The entire point of remakes should be to show off what the originals COULD BE without the hardware limitations and with more experience under their belt. It's why in ORAS there's 3d cutscenes of full models and slightly different designs of cities or areas to make them interesting, especially Mauville, Origin Cave, The Granite Cave Mural, and the Sky Tower mural. Hell it's why in HGSS its why there's an entire extra stretch of route and a safari zone, and why the leaves leading to the Tin Tower are a beautiful autumn gold. 

Remaining faithful isn't bad, it's just disappointing considering that Sinnoh was largely held back as the first gen on the DS and could have had massive improvements. I'm sad because Jubilife and Sunnyshore will never look more massive than they were in our hearts as kids. 

Plus the cutesy chibi just isn't going to mesh well AT ALL with the edgy dark shit that's going to happen. How can we take Cyrus seriously after admitting to using his grunts as pawns so he can destroy us all and make a world just for himself when he looks like a Nendoroid? How are we supposed to be as freaked out by the Old Chateau when our Mc looks like a Funko Pop?",pokemon
The art style for the remakes is fine and if you disagree with that that's also fine,🤝,pokemon
Yeah but those weren’t smooth enough to look actually chibi. You could imagine them being unsmooshed since it was limited by the tech. Now you can’t.,"> limited by the tech

See, this is what OP is failing to grasp, and *miserably.* The ORAS overworld models looked so much better, because they're at least somewhat better-proportioned for 3D models. These chibis are just a huge letdown, and I'm tired of people like OP *always* and *constantly* cropping up to defend stuff that people are remotely negative toward.",pokemon
I’d take half of those sprites over the fingery abomination we got,"Me too honestly. Even if I'm biased by nostalgia(nostalgia is a very powerful force not to be estimated) I'll easily take the 2D sprites of 3D chibis. Although, I think ORAS did a pretty good job with the character models in my opinion.",pokemon
"I don't know, maybe they should take advantage of the hardware they have then recreating something they only did because of hardware limitations.","Are you implying games without Witcher 3 level graphics are bad because they aren’t taking full advantage of the hardware they have?

Super shallow take.",pokemon
"Why is everyone making these posts today? 

Isn't it perfectly normal for people to dislike the 3D chibi artstyle? Different people have different opinions, you know. Just because you like something, doesn't mean other people have to. And you know it's nonsense to claim that the 2D sprites look exactly the same as the 3D chibis.

Besides, gen 7 and 8 didn't have that chibi artstyle at all, so the information in your image is just objectively false.",r/Zelda has been discussing Skyward Sword HD since it has been announced. People there have been mostly cool with disagreement in opinion. I wish we had that kind of atmosphere in this sub.,pokemon
It's almost as if technology improves over time and people expect the latest and greatest.,It's litteraly mind blowing to me that people still accept this low quality garbage...,pokemon
"Always *had* been. Because of hardware limitations. Then, when the hardware got better, the characters got less and less chibi until they stopped being chibi altogether, because chibi no longer needed to exist, and therefore didn't. If I see a chibi character on a handheld system from the early 2000's, that's expected. Don't give me chibis on my home console system from the late 2010's because you can, and should, do better than that.","Which is exactly why Colosseum and Gale of Darkness had such amazing models, because the Gamecube was a much more powerful system than the GBA/DS.

Using chibi models on a home console is just fucking insulting.",pokemon
They looked fine as 2D sprites. The 3D ones look like rip-off Funko Pops.,"Yeah, and I already despise Funko Pops as it is.",pokemon
"I'm not against chibi models in general, but against the models used in particular. Their running animation looks very unorganic und artifical.
I think pokemon should go back to a full 2D style or do something similar to Octopath Traveler or Project Triangle Strategy and try out 2.5D.",I preferred the pixels. Gen 5 looked amazing,pokemon
"Honestly, I just wasn’t expecting them to return to the sprites. Normally remakes are made in the style of the gen mate, so I expected this to be a Sinnoh version of SWSH.",Same here. I was hoping to see a more improved version of the current gen in the form of these remakes. I'll enjoy them anyways though. By the time they release them after showing some more gameplay and screenshots I'm sure I'll have warmed up to the art style.,pokemon
"I mean they broke the pattern of the remakes for no reason.
The pixel art basically looks good cause it was that gen. But the new remakes just look like a toddlers game on a leap frog","Just don’t look at it as a remake, look at it as a remastered",pokemon
"I didn’t want a faithful remake, I wanted a oras but sinnoh. Anyone else?","Yeah it’s weird to not see them push the limit of what a remake could be like. Even then, it’s not like ORAS was too terribly different",pokemon
Zero logic in this post.,"The meme isn’t even in the correct format. The old 2D sprites should be flipped with the new 3D model.

Text should then be “wait, it’s a stylized shibi overworld sprite?” and “always has been”

The use of two “always” in the meme is redundant",pokemon
I think it is still OK to be disappointed in the Diamond and Pearl remakes direction though. I mean if you are still are hyped for it cool. But at least for me it is because it looks so similar to the original that I am disappointed. I really wanted to see a cool next Gen take on the Sinnoh region when this game was remade and it seems like that won't be what we are getting with these games. Looks good but I just feel like I may as well play the originals.,Imo looks worse than the original.,pokemon
Pokémon Let's Go didn't had them.,And?,pokemon
"No.  I won't stop.  

There is a very real difference between the BDSP sprite and the others.  Chibi can be done right, and I never had a problem with any of the rest of the avatars we had.  Even ORAS, which is arguably the chibi-est of them all.  And Ireally dislike chibi as a style in general, based simply on the opinion that not everything should be compulsively reimagined to look like a child.

Its not wrong to expect the same amount of effort the other remakes got.  And its very clear to see that the effort is not there here.  ""Faithful"" is just code word for ""as little change as possible because daddy TPCi and Gamefreak don't want us to change anything.""  I will bet actual money right now that there will be very little, if any, new content in the remakes.  

Its just another example in a long line of examples of less effort out of the franchise for equal or more money. You all should be upset about this, because your remakes and nostalgia is at risk too.  If they didn't have the ability to make 2 games at once, then don't.  Don't outsource another company to make some low effort chibi garbage just to say you did it, just to appease the fans.  Just dont do it until you can give it proper design effort.",Bingo. Anyone who has been playing the games from the beginning or around that time has noticed the major drop off in quality.,pokemon
I like turtles,Honestly the best comment I have seen here.,pokemon
Anyone pretending the models don’t look like crap is lying to themselves.,I like them better than anything they’ve done in the 3D era. Sue me.,pokemon
Am I crazy for liking it? I mean I just think about it the same way the 2D sprites worked. The perspective is still zoomed out and hides some of the rigidity of the models all the same so it won’t look crazy while actual playing it. That’s my bad opinion though.,"According to about 75% of the ""Hate"" side, yes, you are insane and need to go to an asylum.

That said, yeah i like it. Shading, as many of the ""Black outline"" posts show, could be better but its easier to change shaders than models (Apparently Borderlands didnt even have the cel shading style its known for until a few months from release)",pokemon
Would be cool to see another game in pixel graphics but like higher resolution in the overworld,"Imagine a pokemon game that looks like octopath traveler, that would be like the gen 5 style on the switch",pokemon
"Still don’t know why they don’t look like the Let’s Go ones, would have been perfect like that","$$$ is why. Less work, mo money.",pokemon
I just wish they were going back to 2D lmao,Same. I have never really liked how the games looked after they went too 3d. But I never complained because it wasn't that big of a deal.,pokemon
"Please stop... stop what? Complaining about their garbage model? 

This game releases around 2021 winter, too many people are happy with this 2006 quality mass. 

YOU need to stop accepting garbage standards before telling people to not complain about product they can rightfully criticize about as consumers.","You should stop telling people what is acceptable to enjoy.  Not everyone feels that graphics are better one way or another.

If you do feel so strongly about graphics, why bother with Nintendo at all?  They haven't cared about being on the cutting edge of graphics since 2006.",pokemon
"I’m not super impressed with the remake graphics but for what it is I’m still excited.

Legends and Snap look beautiful though and if those framerate issues get solved I am going to be beyond hype for that",Honestly my only gripe is that the artstyle feels like they wanted to go for a links awakening vibe and just quit halfway and left. It just looks off a lot in the trailer. Still hyped.,pokemon
I like that people get mad about these memes like there aren’t just as many on the sub about how ugly the game looks lol,"To be fair, most of those posts don't go ""Your opinion doesn't matter, they look bad. I'm making fun of you for liking it lol"".

Those compare it to other media and are just voicing their opinion in good fun, not attacking anyone for it. There might be exceptions because of course there are angry and hostile people on both sides, but at least the ones I've seen are pretty tame in comparison with the ones from the ""liking BDSP"" side of the argument.",pokemon
"Funny meme but if anything it highlights how much wildly better the chibi style works in 2D than in 3D. 

Personally I think the style used in XY was the best 3D rendition.","I dunno, the 3D chibi style is pretty adorable. It kinda reminds me of the art style they used for the LoZ Link's Awakening remake",pokemon
"Pretty much none of the sprites on the left are chibi lmao, fuck outta here. You can even see the proportions on half of them match the body just fine.","The chibi artstyle: Big head, small body

The sprites: Big head, small body

You: “No this isn’t chibi”",pokemon
Was it physically possible for those past consoles to not be chibi in overworld tho?,Yes. The DS games could have looked different but would have had other limitations. like smaller maps.,pokemon
imagine how shocked nintendo must feel for this sudden realization that players don’t like the chibi style,There has always been people who like it and dislike it. Chibi art style isn't exactly a new thing. Many love it.,pokemon
"Well the 2D games had a lot more limitations harware wise. Therefore if you want a character to be recognizable, you have to make features, that are responsible for that, stand out. And since the handhelds before the 3DS had pretty small screens you wouldnt even be able to see something as a face. And even then it just barely works. Take a look at the original sprites. 

The switch doesnt have those limitations. Its a deliberate choice to make the characters look like this and many people dont think it translates well. And thats why I dont consider the 2D games chibi.","Pokémon ranger was on the same console as DP and had realistic proportions and even had its character sprites blink. It was very much possible to do a Pokémon game with more realistic proportions on the DS. But they decided to keep the same style  they used since Gen 1, with the only real difference being more pixels, colour and 3D environments.",pokemon
even if you ignore the characters the game looks bad like the overworld is just not good enough and you know its going to be 60$ for this right,You do relise that games with much lower graphics sell for full price right? Graphics don't typically indicate price at all.,pokemon
"I grew up on garbage Pokémon graphics. I bowed out for a while after R&S. And always loved stadium and coliseum because of 3D. Fast forward a decade and some change, my son gets into Pokémon.

He’s 8. He loves everything he’s seen in the Pokémon trailers for upcoming stuff. 

I’m just excited I get to play a Gen I skipped over/let go to play other games instead. With my son, with a look I’m personally really not upset with. Like sure I get where some people are with it, but Idgaf because the game is almost as old as me.

People defending those horrible graphics really want to ignore the fact that ORAS looked better and its not just the sprites its the color of the grass and trees aswell.

No. Just because that's how something has been for years doesn't mean this franchise shouldn't grow and become better.

"All they gotta do is stylize em and people, including myself, would like em

Honestly it is so fitting that one of the worst pokemon gen get's a remake with the worst chibi models,"Agreed. Everyone who loves gen 4 loves it for the nostalgia.

"Looker only appears in Platinum. If this is a “faithful recreation”, he won’t be in the game. Just sayin. I wouldn’t get your hopes up yet.",They already showed Porygon-Z and a flower-girl NPC that was only in Platinum in the trailer. So it's likely the remakes are based on Platinum.,pokemon
Looker is one of my least favorite characters from any generation.,"Hmm, we have differing opinions. I love his character. Let's settle on one thing though. His theme is *bomb*",pokemon
"Looker was only in Platinum though. These are meant to be TRUE remakes of the originals, and not something like FRLG/HGSS/ORAS.",Nah man I think they only meant in design-Haven’t you seen the platinum elements they added in? It’s probably gonna be mixed up.,pokemon

"New Pokémon Snap looks so fun, I’ve been waiting for that WAY longer than I’ve been waiting for DP remakes.","I hear ya. I remember when 3rd Gen came around, and Gamecube was getting bigger and bigger, my friends and I were day dreaming about another Pokémon Snap. But all these years later. Not gonna lie, I almost cried when the announcement was made.",pokemon
"Snap gang here!! Man SO MANY GOOD MEMORIES playing snap as a kid. Every snack thrown would affect the whole course in a way. LOVE how there’s so many secrets to find! And the Mew course always epic. I don’t think there was a level I didn’t like. So so replay-able. Oh, I can’t wait to play this for hours and I am a grown ass adult lol.","Yooo Snap fam!! Same for sure! Tracking down the secrets was so fun, and I loved seeing the Pokémon in their natural habitats interacting. That's what makes me so excited for the new snap; the trailer makes the world feel so alive.",pokemon
New Snap gang,"Snap gang 4 lyfe!! Meganium is one of my favorites, so I'm extra excited for this new game 🌸",pokemon
Most likely not. You folk are just more quiet.,"I feel that. I'm really excited for it though. I'm keeping my hopes realistic, but I would love if they included shiny Pokémon as well ✨",pokemon
I’m so happy we can keep 4 different pictures of each Pokémon in the scrapbook (saw it in the trailer) it was SO HARD to decide which photos to keep when you could only keep 1 and the other was gone forever.,"Honestly though! That will be such a nice feature, especially being the picture hoarder I am on my phone.",pokemon

I’ve never played snap before! But the graphics look gorgeous and it seems so fun :D,"The first one was super good. Very chill. I wish they'd port it to the Switch as well, haha.",pokemon

"The only thing I can complain about for Snap is the name. Other than that, I’m pumped.","It's not the most clever name around but as long as the game holds up, I'm good lol",pokemon
I’ve never played it. Can you tell me what’s the appeal?,"The first one was super chill. I enjoy the main series games as well, but you don't need to know types or strategies or any of that. (If those things frustrate you in the main games at least).

The levels in the first game were on rails, so each time through you will get the same events (on one level for instance, several Rapidash run past at the very start, but if you don't know you might not get a great photo... But the next time you are expecting it!)

There's also a lot of replay value for each level. As you get photos of more species (that's how you add to your pokedex) you unlock new items to use on the levels you can play, such as apples to throw out to get Pokemon to come closer, and a ""dash engine"" to go more quickly through the level if there's a particular Pokemon you want to photograph). It was a lot of fun to try and get interesting or funny shots.",pokemon
I’m playing platinum and n64 Pokémon snap in preparations for all the new games. I love snap,"Nice! Unfortunately, I no longer have my 64, but I'm also playing through platinum again. I went with piplup this time around.",pokemon
I am curious if it will have the same amount of playtime. With the old one it was not that long. You have it done in a day. But i am a little bit on the edge paying 60 euros for one fun day idk. I just hope its a little bit longer than the original :),I'm sure they will pad it out with a completion bonus and side quests to give you a reason to return to previous levels.,pokemon

"Pokémon snap is boring. Even as a kid, I was like why is this a thing.",It was just cool seeing Pokemon in their natural habitat doing natural stuff.,pokemon
Same. I'm so hyped for legends and new snap,"Ditto. Pretty much lowered my expectations for the remakes right out the gate, but I want something different from the formula for a change of pace.",pokemon
I am hyped at both but legends arceus need some pretty good fixes before releasing. The gameplay and methode sucks a little bit. Overworld looks not filled. But I know that’s because they aren’t very far in creating the game.,"Yeah, if they released it right now it wouldn't be great, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they just rushed out a very small working demo to show off for this presents. I really doubt the world would be this empty and the frame rate stuff and everything could very easily be fixed in the year or so they have to finish and polish. Not getting my hopes up too high obviously, but I'm very excited.",pokemon
Why not both?,Because you’re suppose to hate everything that everyone else hates. That’s why he said “everyone”.,pokemon
"Yes I am the same way. However I watched a video where some guy took the chibi sprites and added outlines to them, and they look a billion times better. He also added some color to the landscapes and that looked amazing as well. So hopefully the game studio developing it will look at that and see just how better it looks, but I get the impression they might try to make it a mobile port",Well don't be shy. Share the video. I wanna see.,pokemon

"Sooo...this episode happened. Probably gonna be a short review since these half episodes tend to be actual filler. I thought they were cute. The Gulpin bit reminded me a lot of Cinderace and Lucario’s sticky situation and the fact that Ash and Goh held hands was icing on the cake. I was at first curious as to why Goh didn’t try to catch the Gulpin on his head, but I remembered that these were all conveniently Team Rocket’s Gulpin so even if he considered catching it, it wouldn’t have worked.

The Chewtle bit was cute and probably the strongest episode, although it was another dialogue-heavy section, so that might be a rewatch. I wish Chewtle was simply one of Jessie or James’ Pokémon and not part of the Prize Master. Similar to Morpeko, it seems limited to cameos and I wish we could have more frequent mons in this show besides Cinderace, Sobble and Pikachu. I loved how their battle involved all of the turtle Pokémon and that trainer who I’m just gonna call Master Roshi, I don’t care if he has an actual title. 

Overall. I’m not a fan of these episodes. But their precursors to bigger episodes and oh boy is next week a doozy because the long-awaited Grookey is showing up. We all knew Goh would get Scorbunny. And we bit our tongues when he got Sobble. But if this kid nabs the last Galar starter, I am legitimately going to be upset that this show has shafted Ash so much. There’s no rule that says that Ash MUST have at least one current starter, but to give all three to Goh would be nuts, especially when Ash’s only Galar-exclusive mon hasn’t appeared since its capture.",Who WAS Ash's Galar-exclusive?,pokemon
"...but what about ""ya boy Guzma""?",NOT. BEST. BOY. JAMES. OR. PURE. BOY. N. :),pokemon

"Since it’s made by the developers that made HOME, it would be really strange if it couldn’t use it at all. It seems to be pretty much a standard Pokemon game, so I’m assuming it has as much withdraw/deposit ability as SwSh.

Nat Dex issues is a separate thing. It’s very possible it’ll just be the Sinnoh Dex programmed-in. I hope it’s more (like Gen V+), but if so, that’s an announcement for another day since the trailer we got was focusing on the faithfulness. Personally, whether I’m interested or not hinges on that since otherwise, why not just play the originals?",I agree with that completely. A friend of mine were discussing this and we were thinking how we literally would've been just as happy with a direct port of gen 4 if they were going to be this straight up faithful. If they dropped the direct port immediately after the direct with home support just like they did for gen 1 for the 20th anniversary we woudl've been just as pleased.,pokemon

Its because the fans aren't a monolith and want varying things.  The people who dislike the remakes art style are possibly those who were fine with SwSh's looks.,"no, it's because people complained about the graphics not the art style, graphics =/= art style",pokemon

"Basically, bidoof is a really good HM slave and also very cute. It's evolution is similar but with better stats and a better typing.

I got a shiny one in Pokémon Y lol","Its also got one of the ""better"" abilities among the early route Normal types at the time with Simple doubling all its stat changes, and Unaware letting it outright ignore the Opponent's, both of which are pretty good for offensive Bidoof builds (if not being relegated to HM slave status, but even at that the HM moves it ends up being given are almost always STAB and have some play in battles if need be). Its really only beaten out by the Starly line, which picks up Intimidate as Staraptor, and the utility of the Zigzagoon line's Pickup (though this all changes as Gen 5 onwards got rolled out).",pokemon

The Sinnoh timeline in Legends is actually far more likely to reference the Meiji Period - which moved *away* from feudalism.,"Good video by Gnoggin, aye?",pokemon

"But it’s not feudal Japan tho. That would imply there in the Japanese equivalent of Medieval Europe.

Now I’m leaning with /u/Fabiojoose’s theory that it’s somewhat like Ruruoni Kenshin’s story where there are still samurais roaming around after the war.

We know. An explanation of them gets posted every day,Sorry I should have checked it first.,pokemon
"It‘s NOT based on feudal Japan. Please stop saying that, everyone. It‘s obviously inspired by the Meiji-Era which comes right after the Edo-period and lasted basically during during the second half of the 19th century.
Does this mean that these games take place in Sinnoh from 150~ years ago? No, it‘s simply inspired by it.","No you don’t understand. It’s a Japanese game that looks like it’s set in the past, so it has to be feudal Japan. No other era exists.",pokemon

"I don't get why they made Samurott quadrupedal with a shell horn.

They had good design choices with the 'stache and the shell armor (its Hidden Ability, too, ha).

But why for the love of Arceus did they not keep Samurott bipedal and have a shell for its conical hat/weapon? That seems like the most natural progression for design, and they spat out... a narwhal with legs.","It has dual swords sheathed in the armor on its forelegs, though.

I do agree that the design would've improved had it been bipedal (with a proper build). As for its helmet, it is based on a type of sea-shell, iirc. I kinda like it.",pokemon
It’s not feudal Japan it’s the Meiji period in 1970 and there are many indications for that😅,The Meiji Period ended in 1912. That would be during the Showa Period.,pokemon

"Sure, kids are the audience, but I don't think that's much of an excuse for easier games (or things like removing the battle frontier) when these games were always for kids.",im not excusing it im just saying that removing it wasn’t as bad as people say it is,pokemon
"I could not agree more. 

I think what makes people think any different is the VOCAL part of the playerbase. That part is obviously older BUT also a drastic minority. Like just look at this subreddit. 3.2 million users, thats probably not even 1% of the Playerbase. 

This tilts the felt reality and then many people think that its NOT mostly kids, but this game is clearly targed at kids and the main money comes from kids. 

If removing battle frontier was good or bad is probably subjective. I am old as fuck (I was honestly already too old to play the original Gen 3 according to some people) and I hate every sort of Battle Frontier, Battle tower or what not. It just gives nothing to me outside of gating some items I want.","> 3.2 million users, thats probably not even 1% of the Playerbase.

Considering they’re not selling 320 million copies of the game, no.",pokemon
Not very popular among children in Japan in comparison to Fortnite,i think theres a difference between popular and trending.,pokemon
"I noticed this in their official trailer. See the 3 books stacked together?

Arceus is also known as the Trio Master, master to creation trio and lake guardians. All of those were from Sinnoh. If those were the next this make sense.",I really hope it’s a trilogy that would be great for the Pokémon universe to have more lore in games,pokemon
I’m so hyped that his 3D model has his flames back,Hell yeah man,pokemon
Sirfetch'd is the boss,That’s why he’s addressed as Sir,pokemon
"I think a lot of the starters. The 3d evos feel off to me after gen 2, they become too humanoid. Not all of them but I'm too lazy to think of all the starters :p",Absolutely they're all too humanoid on the fire starters. The other two types are mostly fine tho outside of a couple outliers,pokemon
"I like Marill, Electabuzz, and Corvisquire.",Marill is great yes. Electabuzz is cool but also throws me off a bit idk. Corvus quite is eh to me but I get it.,pokemon
Pikachu is a clear fan-favorite. But logically they all have good designs because they got approved to be in a game at some point or two. But a particularly preferred of mine would be haunter.,"Oh Man i didn't even think of Pikachu lol. I personally like Raichu a ton tho but yeah he's definitely the top one. And yes! The Ghastly lime is really disjointed tbh. I like both Haunter and Gengar a lot but yes, Haunter is great on its own",pokemon
"Ivysaur, Pikachu, grovyle, kadabra, haunter, electabuzz.",I'm surprised at the Ivysaur and Grovyle love. To me they're just smaller versions of their third evo,pokemon
"If you just want to have decks to play, picking up some of the premade theme decks is a good place to start.  Then as you add to your collection you can modify those or build all new ones.",Thank you I’ll look into those,pokemon

"Love the idea of a new game plus, with your current team but every trainer has massively boosted levels",Came here to say this. Would be great!,pokemon
"Yes, that would be the next in line to get a remake.",or they may do another johto remake since that's problay due for a remake again since its in the same generation as dp and has the same kind of graphics.,pokemon
"Also, where the f!ck did you pull an ""f""?",It’s on the mirror side of where they pulled the “u”. :),pokemon
"Funnily enough: By combining the letters of Diamond and Pearl you get the word Palindrome. And a Palindrome is a word that can be read in both ways. Which would turn Diamond and Pearl into lraep and Dnomaid, which makes no sense.

gen 5 remakes when?,2027,pokemon
when?,"Hopefully soon, gamefreaks takin their sweet time making another bad game... /s",pokemon
Didn't the unova games already get remakes or were they sequels?,Those were sequels,pokemon
This unfortunately would mess up the entire system. Since this would make those OP forms Permanent. Even nerfed would rival legendaries. Plus this would give some Pokémon a 4th evolution. And some even a split 4th evolution. This would make the Megas of Charizard and mewtwo absolute gods. They would be the center of everyone’s team.,And whew eviolite on 3rd stage egos!?,pokemon
I think they also picked Pokémon who didn’t get much representation. So those three made sense,While I agree with this by part and support it too since they’re really good starters I don’t feel Rowlet didn’t get representation so this probably doesn’t apply there,pokemon
"Cool, very creative idea. Looks nice.","Cant really take the praise for the idea, I’m studying architecture and I have a professor who is a huge nerd so for this week which was a break from a bigger more serious program we got the assignment to build a 3D model from a 2D game.

Trying so hard to commit to Cyndaquil but these Oshawott memes are making it tough,"I'm so torn because those two are my go-to starters in their respective regions. I'm probably going to play the game multiple times anyway so it probably won't matter, but it's such a hard choice!",pokemon
"A more accurate translation:  
""It is the year 200 in the land of Sinnoh, and our lord Arceus blesses this land""

BTW, for people who aren't versed in Japanese, DeepL tends to be much more accurate than Google Translate.

"Since numbers look different than the Japanese characters, I like to imagine he's speaking Japanese and then suddenly saying TWO HUNDRED",I mean Japanese uses Roman numerals today most of the time to count stuff now so it's not really out of place. But in the context of the meme it is out of place because they'd use Chinese characters to count back then and also be speaking in early modern Japanese,pokemon
"This made me realise - we haven’t had a region based on a Japanese region since original DP.
Unova = US

Kalos = France

Alola = Hawaii

Galar = Britain


And with each subsequent game there’s been increasing focus on... beating us over the head with the region’s setting.

In the case of Legends: Arceus, I’m down to clown. Gimme some old-timey Japanese stuff for my inner weeb.","I mean, 4 regions based on Japan is enough IMO lol",pokemon

"Oh no I'm outdated, I don't know what's this meme about?","Pokemon Legends Arceus has an ensemble starter selection of Oshawott, Rowlet, and Cyndaquil.

The japanese here is incorrect and the correct parts sound very unnatural. Something like ここは200年のシンオウというところであり、土地がアルセウス様に祝われています,"its a shit post, im a portuguese person writting in english and google translating to japanese, of course its wrong lmao",pokemon

"I agree with a lot of what you said, I am extremely disappointed that these are the Gen 4 remakes/nostalgia trips we’re getting. Imo they should give pokemon to a new, bigger team that can focus solely on the series. I don’t think GameFreak deserves to be trusted to make high quality games that can stand with the rest of the pokemon series. Like you, I would love if I was wrong, I would love if they delay the remakes and change the art style of BDSP, I would love if Legends gets delayed and it can end up “Pokemon Breath of the Wild” but unfortunately there’s absolutely no reason to expect that right now",">I don’t think GameFreak deserves to be trusted to make high quality games that can stand with the rest of the Pokemon series

What does Stadium have that Sword/Shield don’t? Yes I know Sw/Sh have other deficiencies but I think the idea behind Stadium is obsolete in the Switch-era.,Ok heres what staium had it had fun mini games one an interesting   combat system  cause there were bracket  for what you could do  and your pokemon had to be at that certain  level,pokemon

tip: always try to catch shadow pokemon when you first encounter it. in rematch battles only its possible for shadow pokemon to be shiny for the opponent and not you.,"its the first time i have played it and still learning, many more parts to coming and i think im gettin g better.

Thanks for your advice.",pokemon
Legends though,What if 9/10?,pokemon
"Like the artstyle is alright, the execution could be better but whaterver. I just wanted a more convenient way of playing D/P anyway. Assuming ""faithful"" doesn't include the awful game speed, I'm totally okay with the remakes.","On the website it states ""modern Pokemon conviniences"" so hopefully that means faster HP bars and inclusive exp share.",pokemon
My biggest gripe is the lack of character redesigns. OrAs gave fun redesigns to nearly every character. They’re trying to recreate the exact same experience again rather than mix it up,"The people at game freak who would normally be taking creative liberties to update things like character designs are currently busy working on Legends.  Hell, Lucas and Dawn got redesigned art for Legends, plus handdrawn character portraits -- whereas for BDSP they aren't redesigned and they didn't get the charming handdrawn illustrations either.

I'd wager Game Freak said ""ILCA we don't trust you to update the designs, but we're too busy to do it, so just replicate everything from DP""",pokemon
Don't make wishes with Pokemon games. You'll only get them in some Monkey's Paw-esque fashion.,"This is basically what this has taught me. Never ask for anything in this community, because when you get it and they fuck it up royally you'll be told to accept what you asked for even if that's not really what you asked for.",pokemon
"Honestly I was a little disappointed by the top down animation at first, but it's starting to grow on me and we still don't really know what this game will have as far as features go. So I'm keeping an open mind. Hopefully they'll make it worth the $60 price tag.",Do you think pokemon is gonna put in any effort? They probably are gonna to do the bare minimum to get your 60 dollars. Thats probably the reason they made these games top down. My theory is they knew legends wouldn't come out in time for the holidays in 2020. So they're just rushing this out because they know no matter what they do people will buy their games,pokemon
"I don't know about anyone else, but I'm disappointed not necessarily in what they're making - just the fact that it means they'll never make a DP remake closer to what I wanted. 

I wanted something closer to XY, SuMo, or, as I had thought it would be, SwSh. Now the remake will seemingly just be a game I like with a graphical overhaul I'm not the biggest fan of.",Crown tundra but in Sinnoh was what they should have done instead of this lego duplo garbage,pokemon
"Can you blame them? People expected a reimagined Sinnoh, brought up to the standards of the latest gen, like literally every other pair of remakes we've got so far. Instead we got the same thing as 15 years ago but slightly more 3D.",Exactly! How do you expect fans not to be mad when their favorite generation has been turned into lego duplo instead of SwSh standards.,pokemon
I expected they would at least try to upgrade the graphics and not downgrade them,They could have at least kept it the same as Gen 6,pokemon
"No one expected the game to look like MySims for the Nintendo DS from 2007, the same year the original games released... And the characters to look like funko pop toys. The outrage seems very mild if anything. I'm glad my first region gets a remake but the visuals took generational leaps backwards.",Seriously though. A Let's Go artsyle of remake was probably EVERYONES minimum expectations for this remake. I know NOBODY wanted the game to look like this...,pokemon
Well yeah obviously everything is linked to expectations.,"Yup.

What we got: ""It's the same game but with a z axis now! Also the players look like MySims characters!""",pokemon
"It’s not as simple as “there’s just no pleasing some people”.
(For some individuals it is, but it’s not fair to paint everyone with that brush). 

Yes, a remake is coming but the first glance at it is absolutely not what anyone was expecting. Objectively speaking, is it really fair to dismiss people who aren’t happy with the look of the remakes? Everyone’s entitled to an opinion, and to voice it.

I don’t really care - Legends: Arceus seems to have the graphical style (and indeed the region) I would’ve hoped for from the remakes. I’ll just play that, instead. But don’t tell people to be happy with BD/SP just because they exist 🤣

(If you’re excited for the remakes, good for you friend. Not trying to take that away from anyone).","Exactly. I feel like a lot of people are more conflicted then upset. We’re happy we got remakes, but who really waited 10+ years for chibi art style.",pokemon
"Honestly it’s not that I didn’t want remakes, but I expected more than a semi-HD 1:1 remake. The other remakes gave me more than updated graphics to the same graphical style.

I’m not here to tell people not to be excited if they really wanted Gen 4 remakes but damn do I feel whelmed.",">The other remakes gave me more than updated graphics to the same graphical style.

The issue is that the new graphics kinda already look outdated. It looks like a Wii game in higher resolution (kinda like Mario Galaxy).",pokemon

"Honestly, the whole situation makes me want to cry and crack up at the same time. The Sinnoh remakes—the most universally anticipated games within the fandom—became yet another controversy the exact SECOND they were revealed. It’s like Pokémon just can’t NOT split its fandom in half with each new game anymore.

Well, it’s no skin off my back; now that all hope for peace within our fandom is dead, I can finally stop being miserable over the state of the community and start enjoying Pokémon for myself again!",">It’s like Pokémon just can’t NOT split its fandom in half with each new game anymore

But no it’s a remake, it uses a totally different engine",pokemon
I never got to play HG/SS or OR/AS so was really excited to know these would be released on switch. I admit my excitement lessened a bit seeing the trailer. I think a game remake can either keep the same game at core and purely focus on the graphical update to modern day e.g crash and spyro franchise. Or keep with the same artsyle and overhaul the mechanics and what the game can do. Otherwise you could just pick up the original games and play those. I just don't feel at this stage either mark has been hit.,HG/SS were really well done and I highly recommend playing them if you can.,pokemon
"It's really weird to me that we'll be exploring Sinnoh twice within what I assume will be 4-6 month time span.

It'd probably be amazing. Especially since they had quite some time since SW and SH to iron out the technical problems.",pokemon
All we have of the remakes is a 1 minute trailer and people are already complaining about it,Trailers are supposed to give you an idea of the product that they're going to be selling. It makes sense for people to be critical of that. That's the point.,pokemon

"People have been wanting it since way back when Game Freak used to actually improve the games and add fun features. They don't anymore, so we all see it as the lazy nostalgia cash grab that it is.

"> Truly SwSd needed more time and focus ...

I agree with most points and wish to contribute something that is overlooked. 

People believe that the games need more time and resources put into them, and this should be feasible  because of how profitable the franchise is. What is overlooked is how the franchise is profitable. It is a commonly known statistic that the games only contribute at most 1/3 of all profits, so the rest is merchandise.

An interesting thing to consider is that SwSh are no different than the other ""first rounds"" of a generation - they lay the foundation of the content from the Pokemon to the region to the characters. The problem with delaying them is that, as things are, this would mean a delay on a lot of the merchandise and content for the rest of the franchise. Try and imagine the economic consequences of having to delay all that product. And not just for TPC. For all their partners who contribute by working the factories and working shipping logistics and other things.

There is actually a running deficit for the franchise if the games that are generational starting points are delayed.","True  

I often also try to point this out exactly but people often just want to throw Gamefreak under the bus but aren't taking in the full picture when argue about how they could do something like delays instead of rushing. To add even further one should also consider who actually manages all the merchandise(games, anime, tcg, etc...) including act of funding, producing, and likely scheduling the releases. All that falls under the jurisdiction of the Pokemon Company as that's pretty much why Gamefreak, Nintendo, and Creature made it. Thus, in the hypothetical situation in which Gamefreak had indeed wanted to delay it's very likely that the Pokemon Company could just step in and say no. Of course I'm not saying the actual blame is solely on the Pokemon Company as we can never really be sure as to what goes on between them but rather what I mention prior is a distinct possibility   


Probably the real thing that needs to happen is a sit down between all the heads of this Multimedia giant where in which they learn to compromise in some way. Possibly extending the duration of generation adding more outsourced filler games and anime exclusive content(like the Orange Islands) to buy that extra time if don't have anything to feel the extra space between Gens that may be necessary if titles decide to become more complicated going further down the line. They also should probably consider getting external more often if need be like currently believe they're doing for PLA. Basically, they really need a plan.",pokemon

The game generated the pokemon, I only influenced what pokemon the game decided to generate. So the move sets, the nature, everything was generated from the real code for that Pokémon. 

It sure was a happy time in my life and I had so much fun creating the perfect team or giving myself my own personal starter pokemon.",">at that point

I get the idea but like mega by far better,"Any reason?

Im welcome to a new outlook",pokemon
I prefer the simplicity of Megas. They felt like the least gimmicky gimmick,I prefered Z moves for a less gimmicky gimmick they were less in your face then mega evolution and Gigantamax (also they didn't break the game) Z moves didn't really effect the main plot to much but still felt integral to the game though I can see where your coming from and I think we can all agree pokemon is better without any gimmicks,pokemon
Wrong,Care to explain why I'm welcome to a mind change,pokemon
">it's literally just a press this to win button

I feel like I've heard this mentioned about both Mega's and Dynamax.

I like the concept of Mega's, but the execution was awful. Charizard, the poster boy of the franchise apparently, got two Mega Evolutions.

They did it fairly well for some like Beedrill, but like... Lucario? Gengar?

Why?",Yeah they really botched the execution of a cool concept atleast gigantamax was nerfed only allowing three moves forcing you to atleast manage without it for two or three pokemon before pressing the win button,pokemon
"Might be unpopular but I agree with you.

On the bright side, megas have cooler forms and play to a lot of people's favorite Pokemon. They also made for good battles in the anime.

What they didn't make for, however, was a good in game mechanic. Mega's to battle against in the single player of XY were practically nonexistent outside of a couple battles. And even you are extremely restricted in what mega's you can get during the story. They even have to give you multiple free pokemon during the story just to nudge the player to have a Mega that they can use. Its all good concept but poor execution.

Compare that to dynamax where every pokemon can use it regardless of who your favorites are and what team you are using, and you get to have dynamax battles throughout the entire game instead of just once when they give you the mechanic and a few times at the end.

Dynamax to me feels like them learning lessons from mega evolution. It's a shame, because mega evolution conceptually is really cool. And I think that's why it worked out so well for the anime because they weren't hamstrung by the game's limitations.",lando used swords dance. oh oh what happened? thats landorus max airstreaming your whole team.,pokemon
"Honestly I don't really care for these mechanics all that much myself, so I'm inclined to agree in that I really don't see why people love Megas so much more than Gigantimax when they're both pretty similar in concept. There were some Megas that were pretty good, but so many of them were also just plain ugly, like Sharpedo or Tyranitar. Likewise, there were some ugly Gigas, but some, like Butterfry or Chonkchu, were also pretty good. And thematically, Megas being just a form-change powerup is a lot less interesting than giant kaiju forms.",Yeah pokemon should focus on making the core battles more entertaining rather than just tacking on random gimmicks,pokemon
"Honestly, a lot of the G-max designs were good aesthetically. There's a few that I think got too ""goofy"" I guess would be the word, but that's negligible.

The thing is though, combat-wise it was way too simplistic. Just doubling the HP is designed for no reason but to sponge hits. The moves' effects were 1-dimensional which was the same limiting flavor that Z-moves were criticized for.

Really, it seems like the intention of Maxing wasn't to bring an engaging and strategic concept but just to bring the nuke power of Z moves to more hits. It only feels like its purpose is to expedite the battles in a linear fashion.",I agree as in most trainer battles wouldn't suffer without Giga the only real enjoyment they bring is with max raids which could easily be done without Giga I personally think pokemon should focus on making the base battle system more fun rather than add gimmicks I'm just saying that atleast Giga didn't break the game and wasn't just a press to win button like mega evolution,pokemon
"Says super powered pokemon and mentions lucario, charizard and mewtwo. Clearly a low ladder player.  If you have ever played pokemon youd know that those mons arent that powerful in fact they are underpowered.

 Like mewtwo even with both megas isnt close to being as good as mons like necrozma dawn and ultra, xerneas, yveltal etc. Even hooh has seen more play than mewtwo both in vgc and ubers.  My question to you is why did you write this if you have absolutely no idea about competitive play?",I'm talking from a casual standpoint and the main campaign I'm not a competitive player so I wouldn't know how mega has affected that side of the game I'm simply talking about how the main game suffers due to mega evolution,pokemon

* Route designs becoming bare bones, I personally don't like way modern routes have been designed, they've become lazy with how their designed nowadays  

* Not having a free way to transfer Pokémon from past Pokémon games like transferring Pokémon from Black and White and their sequels to X and Y, I know this is a minor nit-pick and I was confused when I reached the post game when I had beaten Pokémon X back in the day that there was no free way to transfer Pokémon up to Gen 6 and beyond  

* Or for those that have a lot of Pokémon, not having Pokémon home be a apart of NSO or at least not having it at a reduced price, I mean Pokémon Bank and Home are pretty much the same thing, but Home is AUD$24.99 while Bank is AUD$6.50 per year and with little to no added new content and also taking the GTS away from the Pokémon games to Home is just dirty  


I wish they would make a new retro styled 2D Pokémon set in a new region with little to no new Pokémon and just focus on the story and maybe bring back past protagonists or past characters that don't get a lot of love, I was thinking they'd do this in the Gen 2 art style  


Sorry for straying off the beaten path like that, anyhow these are my thoughts on modern Pokémon minus the last paragraph, I guess I want Pokémon to be something that it already has been instead of something new","That's interesting, someone who wants Pokemon to go back to its roots. They're kinda already doing it with BDSP, but you want them to go back to the Gen 2 style. Very interesting. Most people just screech out, ""DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR ONCE, GAME FREAK"", and then screech out, ""NO, NOT LIKE THIS, LIKE HOW *I* WANT IT!"" when they do something different for once.",pokemon
How is Koffing losing,Because their main pokemon is a purple snakey boi,pokemon
I like the first one a lot better. The shading on the second one doesn't look right.,"Makes sense. I went way too overboard with the dark colors. The tree was easy, Bugsy was a fucking nightmare.",pokemon
What’s up with that scorbunny and that oshawott tho?,they are friends :D,pokemon
~~I mean I technically wanted Platinum remakes but I'm not complaining.~~,From gen 3 we know they wouldn’t remake the third game,pokemon
"What I hope for:

a) It has the Platinum dex instead of the DP dex (Since Porygon-Z is in the trailer, I guess it's confirmed?)

b) All Pokémon, or at least more Pokémon, would be added back into the game, and SwSh would also be updated to accommodate them

c) It's compatible with SwSh (Seeing the drastically different art style makes me fear that this is not going to be the case)","I assume B and C are unlikely in their entirety, but they will probably go beyond the platinum dex. I have no evidence for this, but just assuming from what we know, they imply the ""faithful recreation"" is constrained to the main story and map. 

I bet there will be some compatibility with SwSh, but I can't guess the extent. It seems silly if there would be no compatibility at all, but it could be that the Legends game is going to be the compatible one and the remakes are going to be standalone, it's hard to tell at this stage. But all previous remakes had some level of compatibility with their gen. The unprecedented style kind of shakes things up a bit though.",pokemon
I love the style! What is incredibly frustrating this time around is that it is EXACTLY what dexers asked for... A faithful recreation of Gen 4. No gimmicks or anything like that. Just white toast Gen 4. You really can't please some people. :c,"is it really what they wanted though? i thought most people were hoping for a 3d sinnoh that looked more like oras, let's go, or swsh. one that had platinum content (not quite confirmed). and one with all the pokemon (not guaranteed, they mentioned something along the lines of ""pokemon available in sinnoh"" in the trailer).

i never saw anyone asking for no gimmicks, most people seemed to like megas at least. 

it's not that ""you can never please pokemon fans"". it's just that, sometimes, people dislike things. i can see why it doesn't bother some people, but the criticisms are valid",pokemon
Anyone else want a little platinum snow added to spice up BDSP?,"Definitely! But not only the snow. Platinum enhanced the look of many locations, especially some towns, by adding new textures e.g. to the ground or the rocks. The best example is the post game island. It looks kinda plain and not really special in DP, but in Platinum it got its own textures and it looks way better! I really hope that they adapt at least a few of Platinum's tweaks.",pokemon
"I don't think that 2D sprites and 3D models are perceived in the same way. I personally never saw my character as a chibi. I always thought of him as the in-battle sprite. With the 3D chibi models, I can't make my imagination do that. It's just not the same. Also, I think the 3D models do have weird proportions (on top of not the best quality in my opinion).","This is definitely a thing. When objects are presented in 2D space, the mind has to compensate by analyzing said object in its own way. I forget what it's exactly called, but in the study of comics it's the difference of realism vs. iconism. 

When something looks realistic, the mind has less opportunities for reinterpretation. It's why a realistic image or live action film looks cringeworthy when they do anime-level stuff, and we find it more difficult to suspend our belief of what the characters on screen are doing (see reactions to Baliwood action films vs. reactions to literally every Shonen action anime).

Meanwhile, the more iconic an object looks in an image, the more the mind has to reinterpret it. That's why a character like a smiley face emoticon/emoji can be used to represent almost anyone's emotions -- we reinterpret it as the sender's face.

When rendered in 3D space, things are more realistic than iconic no matter how simplified the art style is. That's why it's so hard for us to rationalize the Dawn model as being the same person as the full-scale model: our mind cannot negotiate one as being equal to the other. I imagine the reason why some people are perfectly okay with it (myself included) is that their minds are able to negotiate the difference due to accepting the concepts as being an abstract form of the original on a virtual plane, while others are having a harder time doing it because they function more on the plain of literalism. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if artistic people are more likely to accept the chibi form, while people who are well versed in practical or mathematical skills are less likely to. Based on posts on here (artists vs. memers) it would seem to support my hypothesis.

That said, there's still a level of iconism at play when we view 3D images on a screen vs real life no matter what your background is. It's the same reason why some people have an easy time watching very real gore on a TV screen while watching the news, but get nauseous from even minor surgeries in real life -- there's still a level of dissonance between what we see as ""not reality"" vs. what we experience in real space. If you don't get nauseous viewing things like the medizzy sub, but freak out at minor injuries irl you probably know what I mean.",pokemon
I think they need outlines other wise rn they look like blobs,or better lighting and these things can be solved in like a day,pokemon
"Idk what's so hard to understand about this. Some people like the art style, some people don't. It's a matter of opinion. Why is everyone trying so hard to invalidate everyone else's opinion?",Being condescending towards peoples with different opinions has been an increasingly big problem. I started to take notice around USUM’s announcement but I think it’s been a problem for awhile,pokemon
"Translating litarally to 3D is just a bad idea IMO. I get they're trying to be faithful but there's a such thing as *too* faithful. Not my main issue, and I think the games can recover and become somthing I love but god damn they should have gone with the Let's Go style chibis.","They can go 3D and remain faithful at the same time, but only when done right. See how Guilty Gear does it. Their ""sprites"" have shifted to 3D without making it look like 3D. The remake has the charm, but it lacks the polish it needs.",pokemon
The originals are so much nicer to look at,And still perfectly playable! Thanks GameFreak for saving me £50 😁,pokemon
"The issue with these posts is that they really ignore the actual problem that people had with BDSP and go right for the pretentious ""yOu GoT wHaT yOu WaNtEd!!!"" position. What a lot of people wanted was a large SwooSh style remake of Gen 4, not necessarily faithful remakes in 2.5D. This is coming from someone who likes the art style and the direction they're going with this game, it's dishonest to claim that all the detractors are hypocritical and blind to what they're supposed to like.","I hope this gets higher up with time because you're exactly right. There's a lot of different little variables behind everyone's feelings of it but I bet a lot of them stem from this right here.

The trend has always been ""x gen reimagined in the current gen's range"". I think we all expected DP rendered with SWSH's art direction. The fact that this is completely different from that *and* the art style is hit or miss? Hoo boy.",pokemon
It’s the long fat legs and tiny bodies for me. Proportions are just off,"Well, yes, it's stylized. The proportions being ""off"" isn't a criticism unless you only like realistic visuals. You should be able to come up with better criticism than that. Even ""I don't like the proportions"" would make more sense.",pokemon
"I think the issue comes from the fact DPP was the pinnacle of Pokémon graphics, and with this we KNOW they could have made it look like SW/SH or Legends but didn't","I get that Gen 4 was a huge step up from previous generations but you’re being disingenuous if you actually believe it has better graphics than Gen 5. Yeah there was a problem with scaling, but that happens when you have huge layouts and scenery.

Don’t get me wrong, I love Sinnoh but it wasn’t the pinnacle of Pokemon graphics.",pokemon
I’m not a fan of the graphics. compared to sword and shield the graphics are very plain.,compared to sword and shield this doesnt loom shit,pokemon
"The characters look fine, but the world looks like an indie game for 15 bucks","Yep, looks like it's been made with random 3D models from a stock asset library",pokemon
"It's almost as if, by today's standards, a game from 2007 no longer looks good! I remember seeing diamond/pearl in a commercial for the first time, and I was so excited that the buildings were in 3d! That doesn't excite me anymore, and it shouldn't. Technology has come a long way, and Pokemon needs to keep up.","People seem so content with getting the same game but in HD for $60 in 2021, it's actually baffling. Imagine RE2 remake being the same blocky character models and clunky camera angles but in HD. People would've been livid.",pokemon
"Meh, B2W2 will always be the most beautiful one anyway",except pokemon in your team are made up of 7 pixels,pokemon
Very faithful remakes,Just poor implementation.,pokemon
The art style has grown on me. The only thing that really matters to me is if platinum content is included,We do see porygon z in the trailer with is only in platinum and an npc only found in platinum so we might have the platinum dex included,pokemon
How do you get that?,Mod your system,pokemon
"Eeveelutions aren't typically very good anymore due to large power creeps from generation 5 onward. Their stat spreads aren't overly impressive anymore and their movepools are pretty shallow.

In singles they used to be fairly decent in older generations but now they aren't good. Flareon, Leafeon and Glaceon reside in untiered in Smogon. Vaporeon and Jolteon are in PU (the lowest tier). Espeon and Sylveon are 1 tier above in NU. And Umbreon is in RU, again 1 tier above. 

In doubles a couple of them are better. But still incredibly niche. Sylveon is fairly bulky and (with Pixilate) can deal a lot of spread damage with Hyper Voice. Umbreon is actually useable right now as a bulky support. It has a lot of supportive moves (Snarl, Yawn, Taunt and Helping hand being the main ones, maybe you could use Baby Doll Eyes), recovery with Moonlight and can exert offensive pressure with Foul Play. Beyond that the Eeveelutions have no real niche. Vaporeon might be able to work if you really try to, but it still isn't good.

A team of all Eeveelutions is bound to fail in singles or doubles. They just aren't very good. If you want to you could try to make a team using 1 Eeveelution (probably Umbreon) and have some success.",Thanks for the advice I'm thinking about also going with a venusaur and blastoise and also going with articuno and arcanine I don't know tho I need too check the tiers as well,pokemon
"When i bought the Magikarp at Mt. Moon i named it ""Fishy"" because it was a FISHY DEAL

X and Y are really good. I'd play them over sun and moon any day. But I here sun and moon are alright after you get past the hours of them holding your hand so what do I know lol,Ive heard the story is more theatrical in sun and moon and has unskippable cutscenes is that why you dislike sun and moon just curious because I havent played 3ds pokemon yet,pokemon
"Links Awakening looked good tho. It got the colour palette perfectly, the character models looked good and the lighting was good.

That said anyone who thinks the remakes are going to “ruin” gen 4 is deluded.","I don't think that people think remakes will ruin the game, but they'll go on a twitter rant saying how horrible the style is then proceed to preorder it like the gremlins they are",pokemon
Don't compare Link's Awakening remake to that effortless poorly-designed ballsack.,Great job proving OP's point.,pokemon
I might make a post about this too but does anyone else notice how each new Pokémon game on the switch has varying differences in style?,Well New Gen 4 isn't being made by Game Freak but yeah I get what you mean,pokemon
"* Difficulty - They're too easy. Give a difficulty setting of easy, normal, and hard.

* Rivals - Pointless in many aspects. Stop making rivals the same as other rivals. Silver was a literal criminal that stole his starter Pokémon. Why do we not have more variety when it comes to rivals? Stop making all of them such goody-goody best friends. Where's Paul?

* Trade Evolutions - Legit one of my biggest gripes since I started playing Pokémon. There should be NPCs in the game that will do trade evolutions. That little ~~SOB~~ girl Mindy that traded a Haunter is an absolute troll and I hope I can hold her over a giant pit of lego's and let her fall face first. But seriously, Pokémon like Magmortar and Electivire should be able to be traded with in game NPCs in my opinion.",Love all your suggestions,pokemon
"Skip button for dialogue. If I were purely selfish, I'd straight up remove all the story stuff. But for some reason that seems to be a thing other people care about it, so I'll take a compromise and just let me skip it.

Rotom will at least be in BDSP!,"Which begs the question of how they'll handle form changes.

Rotom forms were introduced in Platinum and even then were locked behind an event for some reason.",pokemon
Maybe Ancient Forme Rotom will possess different things altogether.,Karakuri Rotom,pokemon
"Rotom wasn't even discovered then!

Charon discovered and named Rotom as a young child, so until then nobody had enough evidence to prove they even existed.","I think that was supposed to be Cyrus's journal, not Charon's. Not only do we know from NPCs that Cyrus always preferred to tinker with machines as a kid, but Rainbow Rocket Cyrus in USUM is only swayed by the player's Rotom Dex to give up (and he's quite gentle with it) and Cyrus's event in Pokémon Masters is centered around him befriending Sophocles over their love of machines and Elesa's Rotom. He's shown to have a particular soft spot for Rotom and his behavior matches that of the kid in the journal much more than Charon",pokemon
"There's *some* leaked marketing material for Legends that has some screenshots that appear to be in game and [one of them](https://imgur.com/KMDnnVS) *really* clearly has a big health bar up at the top to indicate, like... a boss fight. Though, against what, I can't really make out.

I've seen some apparent 'leaks' here and there that indicate some pretty wild things about Legend's battle system, stuff like that it might use an ATB system instead of being completely turn based, which doesn't *seem* to fit into the UI we saw in the trailer, but I also imagine they were trimming out a lot of the on-screen UI that would be in the final game. All of that would make the idea of a single, big-boss pokemon more interesting than in the current games, I'd just want them to have the guts to make it difficult/longer lasting than say, a raid battle. If they could figure out a way to keep type advantages from trivializing a fight, it'd be a pretty big deal.","Totally with you, the ideas of raid battles was pretty cool (if you remove the Dynamax stuff) something akin to that but a tougher or longer fight would be awesome. Maybe the auras of the boss Pokemon removes type effectiveness, but that's a stretch.",pokemon

"> like Legends: Arceus, but with a story


So Legends: Arceus.","does it really have a story though. I’m talking about an actual Pokémon game, 8 gyms, routes, all that, but it’s all open world. You dont have to take on gyms in order, Pokémon roam freely around the entire map.",pokemon

Unova and Alola not so much though.",Hoenn is just off the coast from Kanto if memory serves.,pokemon
How old are you exactly?,Pictures are like 2 years Old 😂😂,pokemon
"I typically recommend starting with the most recent generation whenever someone asks me this question. Pokemon games are made to be picked up by new players at any point in the franchise. Sword and Shield are solid games for a beginner but they are pricey to have them at their best since the DLC heavily improves the amount and quality of in-game content available. The upside to playing them now though is that you can participate in special raid events, dynamax adventures, and a relatively active online community.

My only caution would be that if you plan on going back to old games just to keep in mind that there are a lot of quality of life features in Sword and Shield that make the games much quicker and smoother overall from a gameplay perspective. If you get too used to having all xp spread throughout your party and the ability to send your party in and out of the PC whenever you want (switch your team composition, basically) then you may really miss that and feel like the older games can be a grind.

Good news is that with a 3DS you can play almost every mainline Pokemon game, so if you want to go old school those are great places to do it. Crystal on the virtual console is great and honestly my favorite of the oldies. Yellow is good if you want to go all the way back to the beginning. And the virtual console games are only like $5 if I remember right so they're great places to dip in and see if you like the franchise or not without paying $40-$100 for the DS, 3DS, and Switch games. And since you're just entering and trying out the franchise for the first time it may be good to spend as little as possible until you know you're into it. Some of the older Pokemon games that people are going to recommend get very expensive or hard to find cheap without getting a broken pirated copy by mistake.

Each Pokemon game usually has its ups and downs so like I said earlier you can never truly go horribly wrong, but just know that if you try one and you don't like it there is probably another with different pros and cons that may be better fitted to you. Unless you really just don't like the rpg mechanics and structure since that hardly changes.","So I’m someone who loves grindy JRPGs ( I know I’m a sick f*ck). 

Just so I understand, you’re recommending that if I like grindy JRPGs the older games would be better for me? Thanks in advance",pokemon
"Generations 4-5 are, in my opinion, the peak of the Pokémon franchise so in a perfect world I’d start there. Only issue being legitimate games cartridges from these generations can get quite expensive. Another option is just hoping into Sword and Shield but this subreddit had mixed feelings about those games so it really comes down to personal judgement.","Tbf sword and shield work when you don't have the ""expectations"" of a switch pokemon game and aren't attached the national Dex.",pokemon
"My first pokemon game was Black. I knew nothing about the games at all, didn't really know any pokemon either.

I was in middle school at the time and one of my friends brought her 3DS to school one day and told me to play it a bit since she was obsessed with pokemon at the time.

I had a lot of fun playing it and ended up asking for a copy and a DS at Christmas time, though! I got more into pokemon after playing it because I really liked the storyline of Black and White, and ended up playing some of the older games after. I've also gotten all the newer games since then, with the exception of Ultra Sun/Moon.

But yeah, based on personal experience I'd recommend black or white. Those were my favourites, with x and y close behind.","Coolio, thanks for the recommendation. If Black wasn’t so expensive I would totally get it, it’s probably the only Pokémon game I have history with. I think I was at the end of elementary school when it came out. I used to play it on my friends DS all the time, however that was a long time ago so I don’t remember much of it.",pokemon
I feel like they’re more likely to get ports because I doubt a remake of a remake would be worth it,"Let's Go is a remake of a ""remake"".",pokemon

"I mean obviously a nuzzlock is entirely self imposed so you can probably choose the rule that suits you the best.


I guess you could say the Pokémon you end up with from the first random adventure you do counts, or you could just ban them all together.

"You could try one, but good luck not having your Pokémon die during it. Also, I'm not sure how you could make this into a ""random"" encounter for the area.",I have already done once still the moment you start the crown tundra you have to take part in one. Also they give you a rent Pokémon to use. I’m just not sure if I can use a level 70 legendary if all my other Pokémon are like level 35,pokemon
"If you're doing a Nuzlocke, I recommend staying the heck away from the Crown Tundra until the post-game. The Levels of the Pokémon there don't scale, and even if you think you can dodge or run from all those level 70 wild Pokémon to get to the Dynamax Lair, that doesn't change the fact that you have to either beat or loose to Peony (who has a lv70 Copperaja and a lv70 Aggron) before you can leave the train station.",What I did was I had in my party one level 11 Pokémon that I didn’t care for going into the battle and let Peony beat me. Then made my way to the Dynamax Lair with the help of my many poke dolls and then battled in a raid and got a level 70 lunala. I’m just asking people if they allow this and how many times,pokemon
"What would also be cool would be a lot of these options could be picked before starting a game. Like setup options or an advanced settings option before starting a save. 
The basic mode just the regular game, easy for young kids to access without accidentally messing it up for themselves.

There could be options for difficulty rises, such as gym leaders having more Pokemon in a team, wild and trainer Pokemon having higher levels, an exp gain nerf, maybe even a randomise encounter options (as far as the games Pokemon availability allows. The only Pokemon which would be left alone would be the final legendary Pokemon encounters, since I don’t think they would want to mess with that in their own game)

A post game option which would be very cool would be ‘alternative endings’. For example, once the main game is completed, you can go to a VR cafe, where you can ‘start your journey again’. It would start you off from the beginning of the game, but would allow, for example, you to join the evil team, alternative gyms/champion, different route spawns (like a drastic difference), maybe even a ‘become a Pokemon professor’ instead of the champion. Maybe even allowing you to play through the game again in this mode, but with changed settings discussed earlier. You could then save your VR play through, being able to leave it for the main game or go back to it. Several VR games with different storylines could be opened at the same time would be great. There could even be a way to, using a rare item, get the Pokemon from the ‘VR’ to the main game (except legendary Pokemon, as I don’t think nintendo would want that)",I like this. Very original.,pokemon
All of those ideas are awesome guys! I really like the adaptability idea where you would catch pokemon specific on your choices throughout the game.,"Glad you thought so! I think a lot can be learned by looking at how the advertising of the games compares to what people actually really want, and it makes me sad to see a community as divided as the pokemon community being ignored by nintendo.

Especially since the tile aspect, sprite styles, and graphics in gen 4 only look that way due to limited technology at the time. No reason to go back to those styles now since tech is way better. Judging by the Let's Go games, it's very possible to redo an old gen with new graphics while still maintaining the original feel.",pokemon
"Two things to note here:

1. Animal Crossing has been faithful with its own style and actually improves upon it every new generation.


2. The problem, at least for me, was never the chibi style for the new remakes. It is the quality. Ugly models with bad lighting, shaders and other technical terms that developers and artists know and can describe better than me.","Yes you are right, but a note to your note ;)  
2: This is not the final release graphic, it will improve, I am sure the textures, outlines, etc. will look better in final release. That was the same with SwSd, the final graphics were quite few steps better than the trailers.

I still think they could have gone for a remake style as int Let's Go, there they also had resonable normal models of the character and the game felt as the originals.",pokemon
Because the Animal Crossing art style is consistent throughout the series and actually gives it a sweet charm to the games. It also has actual shading and better represents the character designs.,Yes. Also because it's an entirely different game. Some people don't understand that,pokemon

What were they thinking😭,They weren't,pokemon
"I don't think the problem is necessarily the huge style change. For Zelda we had Breath of the Wild and then Link's Awakening remake in a 3D Chibi Style. To me is just that the quality of the art style in the BDSP looks ""meh"".","And it looks good and fits in zelda. Also, zelda does not have one set style like pokemon does.

"I know that sword and shield had their problems, but I was impressed by the animation style, particularly in reference to the main characters. And all the clothing and hairstyle choices meant I could make my character look really cool and personal.

The new style makes me a bit uncomfortable initially just because its such a different direction to go in. But I'm gonna buy the game regardless, like I have every one since gen 1.

"RBY aren't remastered on 3DS, just emulated.

But I agree, I kinda wish that they had made new versions of Diamond and Pearl for Switch using Platinum as a base and fixed issues such as slow HP bar as I prefer the sprites over the 3D models of BDSP. However, I imagine it would've been too much work for them if they also had to sprite all of the new Pokemon introduced post gen 4.

I also really don't want remakes of generations past gen 4, I just want ports/remasters which introduce some QOL and additions such as fairy type and so on with minimal graphical touches.

EDIT: I probably should've said post gen 5, though they'd still have to do some work like creating new back sprites for gen 5 Pokemon and create new animations for them in gen 4 style, though that wouldn't be a lot of work since these sprites are only like 2 frames with some interpolated distortions.","Yea I understand it might take a bit more work but I think it could be finished quicker than what they did remodelling the whole region and creating the 3D versions of each Pokémon that wasn’t in Sword and Shield, and yea the slow HP thing was both a good and bad thing lol, I kinda liked it cause it was intense but the game was very slow paced in general, probably one of the only flaws I had with it",pokemon
"Careful, I got downvoted for suggesting this exact thing. Some people don't want compromise

Personally, I'm always in favor of companies taking a preservationist approach to their games and taking a little time to get them working and looking good on new systems FIRST, then only remaking if they feel they have new ideas to add

One common defense of BDSP that I see is ""it's a DS game so they can't just port it to the Switch because the Switch only has one screen."" I think this is a weak argument if you look at games like The World Ends With You: Final Remix. The DS game that's based on used the touch and dual screen capabilities of the DS far more heavily than DPPt, yet it has a fairly well regarded Switch remaster with some bonus content. They had to remake a significant portion of the battle system to make it work, BDSP does not

Not to mention that a remastered port would be easier and cheaper to outsource than converting the game to full 3D. If they were going to outsource anything, I'm not sure why this wasn't their first approach","I don’t think anyone should get mad about an opinion, I’m happy with what we got, I just like the nostalgia of the old games, ain’t a crime to want a remaster, I ain’t complaining",pokemon

Oshawott was quite controversial when he was first revealed and I think there are still people who still absolutely hate him. Also a lot of people seem to struggle with Cyndaquil too since they tend to like Quilava but don't care about the rest. + last time we could pick Cyndaquil as a starter was back in HGSS, so it's kind of nice to have him as an option.

"Hmmm...

town *(noun)* \-- an urban area that has a name, defined boundaries, and local government, and that is generally larger than a village and smaller than a city.

Is this gonna be some inverse cosmic step ladder thing?

village *(noun)* \--  a group of houses and associated buildings, larger than a hamlet and smaller than a town, situated in a rural area.

Okay, well it has to be rural, but what's a hamlet in this context?

hamlet *(noun)* \--  a small settlement, generally one smaller than a village. 

... How unhelpful.

I can't even find an agreed consensus on population size since population density factors into it (there are some real world villages that are larger than some real world cities). Kind of comes down to boundaries, services present, and other factors.

Everything is a hamlet, but most hamlets are bigger. And neighborhood and homestead don't quite fit, either. But ""town"" does have a nice ring to it.

city *(noun)* \-- a large town

Maybe it's intended to be inappropriate and I'm just naive, but they just look like kids to me.

Like the boys wearing cargo shorts below the knee, while the girls wear very short shorts that stop nearly at the top of the thigh. 

As for the bust...to me, on a 10-12 year old that just kind of seems unnecessary. The women around me never really got to that point till like 16-18.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**Dusclops or Galarian Corsola.**

\- Slap an eviolite on either one and you've got yourself a complete wall of a Pokemon.

\- Both have an array of support moves. Corsola's got Strength Sap and Stealth Rocks, and Dusclop's got Memento and Seismic Toss.

\- Corsola's Cursed Body can be pretty annoying; and Dusclop's pressure could be used in stalling. Dusclop's also got Frisk.

&#x200B;

**Sableye.**

\- Only Ghost-type to have the ability Prankster. It's also Dark-type, so it's immune to Prankster.

\- Is not weak to Dark-type moves.

\- Has a plethora of status moves to exploit (Taunt + Prankster is pretty nice). For attacking moves, it has Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch as priority attacking moves (and they're STAB as well).

&#x200B;

**Gourgeist.**

\- It's pretty bulky; you can use Leech Seed and/or Synthesis to sustain HP.

\- Shadow Sneak as a priority move.

\- If you choose the ability Frisk, you could find out what your opponent's item is and use Trick to take it if it's important. I like to use a max speed Small Gourgeist with a Choice Scarf with this method.

&#x200B;

**Mimikyu.**

\- Fairy typing  will help against Dragon types, as well as Fighting types with Knock Off.

\- Disguise, although nerfed, can be useful.

\- Swords Dance can potentially make Mimikyu a sweeper.

**Alolan Marowak.**

\- Lightning Rod can help against those annoying electric moves like Thunder Wave and Volt Switch.

\- Has Stealth Rock. If you decide to use Galarian Corsola instead of Dusclops, you won't need this.

\- Fire-type moves can cover a lot of Pokemon.

"I didn't know this.

But if I had to guess, when doing the international versions they saw they were version exclusive and thought ""teddiursa looks gold, and phanpy looks silver, it makes sense to swap them around""

But for the remakes they kept with the Japanese version.","But they're not the cover Pokemon. Why would they make such a change for normal Pokemon?

Edit: who the fuck is petty enough to downvote me for a genuine question?",pokemon
Teen me was so confused with the change. I bought heart gold hoping for Teddiursa.,Aw man.,pokemon
"Not quite as notable but Lets Go Pikachu had the same version exclusives as Red and Lets Go Eevee the same as Blue, but they swapped the Ekans and Sandshrew lines for some reason

Edit: come to think about it, the reason for this was probably because Vulpix (another former-Blue exclusive) got an ice-type Alolan form too and they wanted to split them between the two games",I’d imagine to allow Vulpix and Sandshrew to be in different games to keep their Alolan forms exclusives too,pokemon
Always disliked how late these two appeared in G/S and their remakes which meant that I never used them in those games.,Thabkfully Crystal changed that if you were willing to deal with a low encounter rate and high flee chance.,pokemon
"I always thought that Phanpy and Donphan were Hoenn bc in the manga Sapphire gets one, and bc I played Soulsilver I never encountered Phanpy once, I only realized about half a year ago when I watched the Johto seasons and Ash got a Phanpy there.","I know Skarmory is a Gen 2 Pokémon, but I always think of the ones on the ash route in Hoenn and Steven’s Skarmory because it’s barely represented in Johto. Same thing with Corsola in the Hoenn water routes and I get it mixed up with Luvdisc sometimes, oops",pokemon
Lets go Phanphy Let's go Teddiursa confirmed?,"Honestly, I think those games would be pretty great",pokemon
Anyone else annoyed with Donphan that they changed the colour scheme from Phanpy? I’d love Donphan if they’d kept it but I find it kinda boring with the black.,"Donphan does resemble a truck tire, but I was concerned for a time as well",pokemon
"The reasons, just like all version exclusives, are to entice you to trade with other players, who also need to buy a game.","The question is why they were swapped in the non-Japanese versions of Gold and Silver, not why they were version exclusive",pokemon
Do you have any other games?,Mainly single player games :(,pokemon
"Cool, but... Can you kill people with it?",I'm positive if you hit someone in the head with the edge it would do some damage.,pokemon
I can’t believe the generation with the most games turned out to be 7,And it’s only because of the Let’s Go entries it currently has the most.,pokemon
"Notice how each game gets smaller and smaller as the years go by. This symbolizes how each game has less and content than before







*joke",I was about to type the same thing haha,pokemon
"I can't get myself to buy Sword (already have shield), the game was tedious enough to get through. Also, since the expansion pass isn't universal and is version exclusive just makes me detest it further.",I feel that. I beat Sword first and got as far as the first gym in Shield before I put it down and never picked it back up.,pokemon
Yo I don’t see Pokémon snap there we gonna have a problem?,"No, no… No problem. I only decided to hoard the main handheld titles since the 90s. Sadly, I do not own Snap in any way, shape, or form and had only rented it from Blockbuster once upon a time. It does exist, however, in my family; I just am not the possessor.",pokemon
But Ruby and Sapphire are switched.,That they are. Very astute attention to detail.,pokemon
Why own both versions of the games? There ae only a few missing pokemon.,Just an avid collector.,pokemon
Cute! Love that boy,"Thanks so much! Snorunt is my favourite pokemon, it was my first shiny, and a random encounter in mount lanakila. He is my child and I still have that very shiny!",pokemon
"So am I, this is good.",Thanks a bunch! I appreciate it. Be sure to upload some of your art onto reddit too! I'd love to see it!,pokemon
Looks very nice!,Thanks! I appreciate it!,pokemon
very cool he looks like a shiny,"Thank you! Yes, he is indeed shiny. He was my first ever shiny in Mount Lanakila, and I love the look of snorunt and glalie! So, because of that encounter, Snorunt became my favourite pokemon!",pokemon
"Can't imagine being sad over Ash dying tbh, at this point it's like dethroning a tyrant",idk latios dying fuckin hurt and he didn’t get to come back 😔,pokemon
thank you for fixing this incredibly sexist meme.,le girl boring boy quirky but other way around bad    >:(,pokemon
Im really hoping for pokemon Legends: mew/mewtwo,"I’d be okay with that but at the same time, more Kanto? 😩Haha I’m hoping for Legends: Mew/Celebi/Jirachi/Genesect/Diancie(or Zygarde) if they do each gen. Idk for Alola cause I feel like Lunala, Solgaleo and Necrozma’s story was already well explained and Magearna and Zeraora don’t feel as big to have their own game",pokemon
"If this is in the past, then I dunno what possible mechanic they could come up with that was ""lost and forgotten to time"", and I highly doubt Dynamax will be a thing in Legends.

I doubt they'll do anything with them aside from *maybe* changing their evolved forms, and even that's a huge maybe.",Primal forms? We know Kyogre and Groudon reverted to primal forms. Maybe more pokemon can/will be able to do the same.,pokemon
I feel like he'd be taller than 4 feet,Mega lucario is 57 in/145 cm,pokemon
"Well, I'm kind of disappointed, I pictured him bigger",It’s like that for a lot of Pokémon. I think it’s cause the character is 10 years old so everything seems bigger in comparison. Looking at charizard being 5’7”. How am I supposed to fly on that?,pokemon
I don't understand... 119 cm is almost 4 feet tall.,119 cm is 46.85 inches,pokemon
They really need to put all of gen 3 on switch :(,It's unlikely that they will do that since the reason gen 1 and gen 2 were given virtual console releases was due to them being disconnected from the rest of the generations because the hardware limitations between the GBC and GBA didn't allow for them to be able to make pokemon transferable between gen 2 and gen 3.,pokemon
But with a dead battery you can manage to trick the RNG and do stuff like finally catch Mew or spawn shinies so it's not that bad,How dat work,pokemon
Is genesect in the swsh Pokédex,I don’t think so. I don’t play the game regularly so don’t take my word for it.,pokemon
Mythical mons need to be in the pokedex before you can transfer them over so a simple tradeback with someone with a genesect would enable you to transfer him over from home,That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard,pokemon
"For Sword? No, not at all. The only thing you can do is put a pokemon in it to take for walks, but you only get a bit of candy and it's far easier to simply farm raids if you need it. 

For Go? Yeah, it can be really handy to just toss it in your pocket or bag and let it collect pokestops for you.",Thanks for the help!,pokemon
"There are other unofficial gadgets better for go, but the Pokeball it's still very good

But at least you can get a mew and your Pokemon from sword on the ball and ear their cries",What other “unofficial gadgets” are there?,pokemon
"Charizard

"Try Haunter/Gengar. The normal immunity will go a long way, and it's got reliable damage in Night Shade, sleep and confusion, and various coverage options off its mighty special. And I suppose that does qualify as your tough poison type.","I used to love gengar when I first played it when I was *cough* younger *cough*. And then I always swapped it out for a psychic type. Might go back to it, thanks.",pokemon
"Nidoking, fearow,  raichu, vaporeon, and snorlax are great with charmander","I *never* even think about vaporeon because there are so many other water types so that’s a good shout, thank you",pokemon
"**Tangela**

\- Might take a while--it's on Route 21.

\- Good defense, can use Mega Drain to heal HP.

\- Can learn Stun Spore, Sleep Powder, and Poison Powder. 

\- Helpful against Giovanni, Lorelei, and Bruno,

&#x200B;

**Lapras**

\- Can find in Saffron City (fifth gym, I believe).

\- Can use the Surf HM.

\- Ice Beam hits a lot of Pokemon for good damage. You can also choose Blizzard for more power. 

\- Helpful against Blaine, Giovanni, and Bruno.

&#x200B;

**Clefairy --> Clefable**

\- Can find Clefairy in Mt. Moon; You can find a Moon Stone either on Route 2 (you must have the Cut HM) or you can find it in Mt. Moon, before the second gym leader.

\- Has a lot of good coverage--Flamethrower, Seismic Toss, even Metronome.

\- Decently defensive; can also use Light screen + Reflect.

\- Helpful against Agatha.

&#x200B;

**Zubat --> Golbat**

\- Can use the Fly HM.

\- Can be found in Mt. Moon.

\- Can help if Tangela or Clefable are threatened by Poison or Fighting types respectively

\- Helpful against Erika and Bruno. Also, there's an exploit with Lance's Dragonite, where, if a poison-type is sent out, Dragonite will keep using Agility & Barrier, so you could take advantage of that with Golbat.

&#x200B;

**Diglett --> Dugtrio**

\- Negates electric weakness of  Charizard and Golbat.

\- Has good speed and has Earthquake. You could even learn Fissure if you wanted to.

\- Can find in Diglett's cave.

\- Helps against Lt. Surge, Blaine, Giovanni, Bruno, and Agatha.","Golbat cannot learn Fly in RBY. Only in *Gen 4* did it get the move.

Charizard can't learn Fly in Red and Blue either. It can in Yellow.",pokemon
"We got Life Dew in Gen 8 which is a full ally side heal for 25%. While your move is stronger, with a 50% heal, I don't like that it heals the opposition as well. Celebi can choose when in time it goes along with who it takes with it so having the move effect just your side would have been fine.","True, but I still feel like a move like this should already exist, even if it is a very bad one. And Celebi does fit it relatively well. I'm not making moves to make Pokémon better in competitive, I'm making moves to compliment a Pokémon's powers, lore or even just Pokédex entries",pokemon
Why you should want a move that heals enemies?? Pulse have sense cause you can choose the target to your ally.,"True, this move isn't particularly useful. But it does fit with Celebi's nature to heal Pokémon. I'm not making moves to make Pokémon better in battle but to make Pokémon more unique from others. I try to make the moves fit the Pokémon's identity and habits rather than its battling capabilities. So yeah, I may occasionally make a unique, but competitively horrible move because of this.",pokemon
"I think you could've leaned into Celebi's ""time-travel"" aspect a bit more. Like say, naming it Restoration Wave rather than regeneration, to imply going back to the past, before the wounds were made.","That would be interesting but I feel like if I made a move like that, I'd have to completely change it to a move that undoes the last turn entirely. While that could be possible, I feel like it would mess too much with the meta. And while I don't focus on the meta when making a move, I still think about it a little bit, and having a move that resets things to how they were 2 turns ago doesn't feel like it should be a possible move. Also, how'd it work with Pokémon who still have to move after that move was used, you could create some really weird effects that I don't think should be part of a battle. 
Going back to your idea, I do think it should be possible for Celebi to take its allies to the past, but that wouldn't be very practical as they'd keep their damage. Celebi could go to the past alone, but that would mean it would reset a turn or more, which I just explained is not functional. So...",pokemon

"The game can't be a 1:1 remake, porygon z is in the trailer which was in platinum only, therefore it has to have platinum elements making it not a 1:1 remake.","I know people keep saying this but it doesn’t mean platinum elements are confirmed. First off Porgyon-Z was in D/P, it was just in the post game, but it was available. Secondly, they show off content in trailers that doesn’t make it to the final game all the time.

Even the whole 1:1 remake thing, we don’t know what “faithful recreations” means. To me, it doesn’t sound promising, but it feels too vague to really confirm or disprove anything.",pokemon
"Late 2021 so like it’s so much time between now and then 

Maybe wait for more info lol","Nah, dont you know how this subreddit works? You need to judge an entire game on the less than 2 min reveal trailer.

If its not in that trailer, than it doesnt exist.",pokemon
"That's my point exactly. I am actually a fan of the chibi artstlye and dont mind that they did that peice of it, but the fact it's the exact same game as DP blows my mind as to why anyone would want to buy it if they already have DP for DS. The only people I could see that would be like ""omg I have to get this"" are people who no longer have a DS or DP. Otherwise you are playing the same exact game and wasting 60 bucks for enhanced graphics coloring or something.","Or people that never played DPPt, there are a lot of new people in the fandom now days. I will say anyone that joined in gen 7 or 8 is in for a shock when they see what HMs are",pokemon
"I mean .... it will probably have Platinum things in it, so it’s already not a 1 to 1 remake.

EDIT: also unless they make the Game extra slow, alone playing on the switch vs the DS seems like a huge upgrade in terms of gameplay. God walking was slow in gen 4",They didn't add any of the emerald stuff into ORAS so I'm kinda scared.,pokemon

"I don't care for Ghost type, but I noticed a lot of Pokemon I like are ghost typing so I guess? Lol",It took a while before I noticed that a large chunk of the Pokémon I like are purple.,pokemon
"I mean, you shouldn't have to lower your expectations to practically nonexistent just so you won't be disappointed in the end.

I do think that this being new territory for them gives them a small bit of leeway when it comes to possibly not doing things ""the right way"" but they should also be held accountable in case it doesn't go right.

I personally won't try to lynch them if there are some things that don't go right, but the biggest thing I'm expecting in this game is lore, and if the lore is essentially ""Yeah, Arceus exists. He created the world and stuff..."" then... yeah, no.","I understand that, totally. And I am with you there, I don't like the approach to lower your expectations in order to not be disappointed. But I also think that we should at least appreciate that they are finally doing something new. Obviously, they should have done that with Sword and Shield, if not even earlier. But at least they are doing it now. And it really looks to be a big project. 

Of course, they should still release a game that can at least be called finished. Which is why I am worrying about the release schedule set out by the Pokemon Company. This game does not look like it's ready for release in basically a year. I hope they get the time they need.",pokemon
"I completely agree, this game shouldn’t be criticized to be put down as another fail by Game Freak. But rather it should be criticized so that they can improve this new formula, and hopefully one day deliver something spectacular.

I’m not saying to give GF a pass, whether the game comes out to be the best Pokémon game ever or another disappointment, people who critique the game when it releases should realize that this is GF doing something new for once and toxic feedback (which was seen with Sw/Sh mostly) will only make them shy away from this new concept and possibly just go back to the same old formula.

Edit: Also i have very strong feeling that Legends is going to be delayed to at least Summer 2022... or at least im hopeful. Dont get me wrong this game could still possibly be good if they dont but who knows lol","To be fair, I think that sales in the end will determine above everything else, if they'll do something like that again or not. Nonetheless, I agree. The criticism of Sword and Shield was very harsh. But, not to a small extent, that was also GameFreak's own fault. They really handled the whole thing poorly, and Sword and Shield simply had enough flaws to be criticized. I've spent the whole last year every now and then partaking in discussions about Sword and Shield and listing the many issues I have with these games, so I may be biased.

But of course, the debates of the last two years have created a very heated situation in the community and we should really realize that this is not the next usual Pokemon game by GameFreak, but a genuinely new attempt at something.",pokemon
"no matter what, it'll sell really well. so hopefully with future games, they can focus on perfecting the engine & graphics. even if future ones aren't open world, i'm confident that they'll have a movable camera which is a huge step up already.

it's really annoying that gamefreak needed 3 switch games before pokemon started looking somewhat like a next-gen game. whereas zelda, mario, xenoblade, fire emblem, etc were critically acclaimed within one entry on the switch. didn't need several games to innovate. when legends arceus releases, it'll be 5 years into the console's lifetime and they're still ""experimenting""? like idk dude...

i get that pokemon makes the most $ from its merch, but i just wish they'd have spent that time making one really good game.","Oh, I totally agree. When they announced a new main line game for the Switch all the way back in 2017 I thought that would be it, the important next step for Pokemon. And honestly, with the first trailers of Sword and Shield, where the dimensions of the Wild Area weren't clear at all (it was so well shot that I'd even call it misleading :P), I still believed it could be. Of course, it was not, not even close. And I think that frustrated many people. Not only that it wasn't a polished, properly finished Pokemon game in general, but that it also wasn't the much needed next step or change of gear. Nonetheless, I am also just glad they are finally doing it. Honestly, before the reveal, I would never have thought that they'll do something like that.",pokemon
"Gamefreak trying out new things is exciting, yes. But it should not change in a way how we handle our criticism of their output.

They have clearly shown by having ILCA taking over the remakes, that they have some leeway in how they approach Pokémon games, that they could hire people or different studios to handle different games to take over some of their workload to prevent being stressed by time.  Nintendo devs didn’t have the skills for botw, They brought in experienced Devs to help them. Why can’t Gamefreak do the same?

The strict time schedule is something they put upon themselves. And even then, if they have less time at hands, then that’s where they should consider changing the scope of their game instead.

Time and scope are the two key metrics in any development project.

Baby steps are fine but they shouldn’t be applauded if something we get is a barely stable PS3 looking game ( and honestly, even comparing what they have shown to games like FFXIII put it in a bad light ). I am tired of seeing calls to allow the bottom of the barrel because they decided to change the barrel a bit.","I really understand where you are coming from. I myself was very, very critical about Sword and Shield and didn't cut Gamefreak any slack. Other than with Legends: Arceus, Sword and Shield were such a traditional Pokemon game with just the Wild Area added as an honestly not very ambitious ""open world"" section at all, that I totally expected them to properly finish and polish the game and not to cut hundreds of Pokemon, reuse most of the  attack animations, put basically all the significant post game content together with two actually better looking Wild Areas into a DLC half the price of the base game and on top of all that not even managing to make the basic rest of the game be good or on level with previous Pokemon games in many regard. 

And I totally see that GameFreak and the Pokemon main line series are behind most other developers and games that can be compared to this series. But I still think that the innovation itself, the mere fact that we get something new for the first time after 25 years is, while not something to applaud, something to acknowledge and keep in mind when judging the game. As I said, you can still judge them and compare them to other games, but maybe don't be too harsh on GameFreak. For Sword and Shield, I understand the resource argument, totally, and I do agree that GameFreak is far from innocent when it comes to the lack of quality there, but this time around, I feel like we should at least keep in mind that there are still the same people in charge at Gamefreak most certainly and that these people have never done something like that before. They should get the technical aspects right, like frame rates, pop-in or graphical quality in general, animations and such. But if they screw up on a conceptual level, we should not be too hard on them this time, I think. 

I don't want people to accept the worst quality, but to keep in mind that we're at least moving into a new direction now. Of course, GameFreak shouldn't totally screw this up and they do have the resources to be obliged to nail certain parts of the game or at least make them decent. But let's also hope that this is their first try at something entirely new and that they have a good concept behind all that.",pokemon
"Nice collection, how about the spin off games? Snap, Colleseum, XD etc.","I've got the original Snap and Stadium, and I'll be getting New Snap for sure!

I never really focused on collecting the side games, even ones like XD where you can trade Pokémon to the main series. But now that I'm DEFINITELY getting Legends, it might be time to re-explore some of those games! (Even though it's officially classified as part of the main series)",pokemon
"I haven't seen people bullying others for liking Oshawott, or being toxic about it.... but I could have just missed it I guess?

"There'll always be a part of the fanbase that become toxic in debating over a ~~FUCKING FICTIONAL OTTER IN A CHILDREN'S GAME~~ facet of the games. The price you pay for being a hardcore fan. But, really, I think it's just a very vocal minority.

That being said, your discussion is pretty entailed. There are many Pokemon that are called underrated that have had quite the attention already. For example, I wouldn't call any starter Pokemon underrated--they have had a whole generation of spotlight, basically.

Wanna talk about underrated? Say hello to my friend Swadloon. (I hope I'm not being biased in saying that)","I agree with what you've said as well. Although if someone calls Pokemon a ""children' game"" (especially since almost every Generation has at least one creepy track and either a pokedex entry or part of the plot that becomes really unsettling, once you think about It. Team Rocket cutting Solwpoke's tail, the childhood abusements of Cyrus, N, Lillie and Gladion etc) It might implies that he or she hates the franchise.

Also Swadloon is a cutie, but you're right about being underrated. Most people I know would try to max It's happiness ASAP, just so they can get Leavanny, which is a beast.",pokemon
Some pixels on a screen really got you feeling some kinda way huh?,"I mean, It's a bit more than ""some pixels on a screen"". Everyone is different and we have different things that piss us off. It's just like fears. It may mean nothing to one person, but others would freak out for sure.",pokemon
"Tbh I will be honest the only reason I’d pick oshawott over rowlet, my favorite starter, is because I picked rowlet for my ultra sun and don’t want to pick him again. I still like oshawott and Samaurott is really cool in my opinion (I prefer the snivy line but still) so idk I just wanted to point it out. Also I’m not gonna judge because I’m pretty sure most people have that starter line they can not stand, mine being chespin as I find those three designs not the best tbh, so I can understand that. (Tbh though no offense I don’t hate chespin *that* much lol)","Yeah, I used to dislike Chespin, but, since I chose Fennekin, my rival (I can't remember her name), gave hers to me and now I warmed up to Chesnaught.",pokemon
"The first time I played bwi chose oshawott because it looked and seemed better at the time than the other two. Now I know better, snivy is best.","That's cool. I used Snivy and It was alright. But I feel like Serperior is more popular among competitive players, due to It's hidden ability.",pokemon

"Nah, Pikachu has a brown pattern on it’s lower back and fades from the base of its tail, only the ears are black tipped. So no, Pikachu never had a black tipped tail, this is a false memory everyone had at some point, because our brain, from memory, can vaguely remember that there’s a different color on the tail but couldn’t recall that it’s at the base, but assumes that “because the ears have black tips, then the tail must also have black tips.”",I seem to remember it used to have white on the end of it tail.,pokemon

How the hell are you gonna put the original games at tier d? Especially yellow that deserves “B” at the very least.  They walked so Platinum could run and then S/M went and got that MS diagnoses.,"If you’re going off the impact of the games then yeah you could make that argument, but I’m going off personal enjoyment for my personal list, and the reality is RBY just don’t hold up well at all for me. They’re horribly unbalanced, and the Kanto region is the most bland of all the regions, there isn’t really much going on and there really aren’t any memorable locations or anything like that besides maybe lavender town. It also really annoys me that Game Freak uses these games in particular for nostalgia bait, even though they haven’t aged well at all. Bottom line, these games are basically unplayable for me now, I do acknowledge the impact they had, but that’s not the criteria I used in this tier list",pokemon
where would pokemon snap for the n64 be ?,"Never actually played that one, this is just a list for all the main line games",pokemon

A few of the gripes I mentioned may show up in any of those games and I'd feel bored at certain segments, but Pokemon's the only series I recall playing where **all** of these are present prominently.

&#x200B;

I had little issue doing completionist runs of any of those. In Persona and Bloodborne, I ""caught them all"" and leveled up to max or near max many times. Bloodborne (even though I have *other* issues with it) managed to keep me hooked so well I was willing to re-spec my character 3 times. ""Wait, you **can't** re-spec in Bloodborne"". Exactly!

Yeah. Here are some thoughts. Gamefreak isn’t the lead developers for this next remake. And everyone has wanted a game with all the all the regions but they have stated that would be too massive for them. Maybe some day as technology improves but pokemon isn’t their only series and they can’t put all their resources into one game. That’s why sword and shield had to release old Pokémon in dlc and not all at launch.,true i used to love the old games the new ones have lost there touch i feel . I really did try to like pokemon shield took me 3 days to beat it tho,pokemon
SwSh kinda did that with the DLC. 2 new areas with their own stories and battle challenges.,see i feel like the dlc were not worth it .. they were to short and the price was to high .. but i did pick it up tho,pokemon

It’s already the peak of Pokémon but I agree this should been the Sinnoh league final.,The unova finals and semi finals were some pretty rad battles. Ash should have won that league too.,pokemon
"I am still of the opinion Ash vs Gary in the Johto league was the peak. The first time they really battled and we finally saw Gary’s Blastoise for the first time. A rivalry several seasons in the making

I wish all gym leaders were like her,"She's the best leader in the entire series. Fuck GameFreak for actually including a gym leader than requires some strategy other than 'spam ember with Quilava until you win', right?",pokemon
Ah yes... Rollout... My Quilava wasnt so happy back in silver. Even with Lv25 it got wrecked...,I couldn't remember her till you guys mentioned rollout,pokemon
"I've honestly never found her that hard. You get multiple chances at catching a Geodude and even a chance at Onix before fighting her, both of which resist every move her Miltank has. Consider picking up one or the other next time you play Johto, and watch her Miltank completely fail to stop you.","Not to mention, if you really want to make her easy you can catch a Drowzee beforehand and use it to do the in-game trade that's in the Goldenrod department store.

The trade gives you a female Machop. So, you're given the opportunity to go into the gym battle with a fighting-type who's immune to Miltank's attract.",pokemon
There is a trade machop in goldenrod and you can use headbutt trees for a herecross which gets brick break in hgss,"That's more or less how I did it, I got myself a heracross and made ground beef out of that cow",pokemon
"Just do what i do: 

If you pick croconaw: 1: use rage and boost attack. 2: use a physical attack and kil.

If you pick quilava: 1: catch a ditto 2: breed it with quilava until you get a female one. 3: get a nidoran male with double kick. 4: breed the female cyndaquil with the male nidoran so that you'll get a cyndaquil with double kick. 5: kill.

If you pick bayleef: 1: bro, why the hell would you choose chickorita?","Okay, first off, I'm about to go and get a Cyndaquil who knows double kick because holy shit that sounds badass. But Second, Chikorita is an incredible and adorable Pokemon who deserves to be cherished",pokemon
"tbh she’s not that hard imo. Just get a Geodude and you should be fine, especially if it’s a female Geodude.",Geogal then,pokemon
"Rollout on a tanky pokemon, in a section of the game (second gym) where most players won't have the tools or knowledge to be able to deal with it.  I always just used smoke screen on cyndaquil as whenever Miltank's rollout misses it resets the attack boost on rollout.","Ah yes, difficult advanced strategies like “catching a Geodude” truly revolutionary",pokemon
"So many hours spent training just to beat Whitney lol. Really one of the toughest gym leaders out there in my memory. Mind you this was back when I played with no guides, no googling. Sure there’s a couple easier ways to beat her, but if you go into the gym with just your usual Pokémon at that point of the game with no expectations, your ass got handed to you.",Because catching a rock type Pokémon in one of the 2 separate caves is a very abnormal way to play yes,pokemon
Censoring a single letter in a word is the most useless thing ever. It does literally nothing. I doubt mods even think it’s explicit.,"I think you should always censor at least two letters if you absolutely must swear, but one is better than none.",pokemon
whitney is not that difficult to beat,"Yea she was a joke if you play correctly.  In all honesty, it's a shame that the game gets easier with every generation.",pokemon
O.k. I've never played this game. Can't you catch a female fighting type to beat her?,You can get a Machop or a Geodude nearby. People were just dumb when they were kids.,pokemon

Some of them are in their unevolved forms since it is easier to draw 😅 And I like Archen. He is really cute!",pokemon
"This is awesome! I love the detail put into his cool character's outfit and how all the Pokemon have different personalities! I don't see enough Archen art. Kinda wish he wasn't so hidden in the back, but like--thats like the ONLY criticism I can think to give! This is amazing. Really looking forward to seeing what else you draw ^^","Thanks a lot for the criticism, I appreciate it! 

And yeah, each Pokemon's personality is based on their respective nature in my friend's game, like Archen having a sassy nature 😄

More Archen art is a blessing ❤️",pokemon

And I'm sorry I wouldn't be able to do art requests right now, since I have a lot of works pending. Again, I'm sorry! 😅",pokemon
"I don't think there is any debate that Charizard is the worst of the three lol. What starter is easier to kill than Charizard?

"Gen 4 remakes would have happened eventually regardless. I bet they will be fine. It's going to play like a traditional Pokémon game. Though I do want to see Chibi Cynthia. 

However that Arceus game looks freaking legit! Still a touch confused on the starters, however I find it neat and not as a detractor. It's not going to be like any pokemon game we've ever had. Has me interested.","The starters are reference to samurai in japan. Samarott is the sword samurai, decidueye is the archer samurai, and typhlosion is reference to shogun. Lockstin just put a video up on youtube explaining why they are the starters.",pokemon
"I don’t think the hate is that hard to understand. If they are making a 1:1 remake, just with Let’s Go Graphics, what’s the point of playing rather than just playing an old copy of the original games. It’s just a graphical upgrade, so far. 

I don’t think we just wanted simple remakes. The reason why people like FR/LG isn’t just because it’s R/B again, but rather an expanded story, more to do, taking advantage of the new resources. The same can be said for HG/SS, and OR/AS. What made those remakes great wasn’t just the nostalgia, but adding more to it the experience. So far what we’ve seen for D/P remakes doesn’t suggest we’ll get more than a simple remake. And the question we have to ask ourselves is, if in the past we got more, why should we be as excited or even more so for less now?",We dont know for sure its 1:1 and wont have anything extra. We know very little at the moment and I am pretty sure they will be adding in more just like always so there is reason to get them. The pokemom community is just toxic and likes to bitch,pokemon
"People didn’t want gen 4 remakes, they wanted gen 4 reinterpretations",Which is pretty much the same thing,pokemon
I don't get why people don't like the chibi artwork it looks really nice,That's your opinion. It's not ours.,pokemon
"There would be hate if they went with a more modern, anime-esque style as well, with people clamoring for more of a classic chibi style. This fanbase is impossible to please.",You mean the literal largest and most profitable media franchise of all time doesn't have fans that all think the same thing? Imagine my shock,pokemon
"reusing memes is so original, in all seriosness if it includes as much new content as HG SS I think we will be fine and also the distortion world prob",I might have taken the I dont want. But I added in the rest myself..... so yes it is original,pokemon
"I mean yeah, the Pokemon Home models are also the same as the Sword/Shield models, which are the same as the Let's Go models, which are the same as the Sun/Moon/Ultra models, which are the same as the X/Y models. They haven't changed them (except for a few minor touch-ups) since Pokemon went 3D; the only major difference between games is in the lighting and rendering effects.

And you know what? I don't have a problem with that. No sense in them remaking hundreds of models from scratch every game, and it's not like Pokemon is the only series that regularly reuses assets. I'm a little more concerned about the animation work--would like to see Flying Pokemon with a different idle animation now that Sky Battles no longer exist.","I agree. If it makes it easier for the developers and allows them to use their time and resources for other aspects of the game, it's a great thing.",pokemon
"I mean if the assets work why would you redo them? No need to reinvent the wheel.

To me it’s actually kind of promising. 

If ILCA are making BDSP and also have assets and everything for Pokémon home, the. BDSP is probably are best bet for something close to a national dex returning. Not sure to what extent but it’s a better chance than 0 if you ask me.","That’s a very fair point, my hope then is that ILCA can focus their time on adding content since they already have the assets",pokemon
But why is this a problem?,"I guess in my opinion, it shows a sense of laziness from the studio, just using a direct dump of assets because it’s easy, and then for the rest of the game it doesn’t really bode well because if they are willing to just dump assets without changing anything about them to be even a little bit fresh then what else are they just going to dump without any change? I guess it also just supports the worries of a lot of fans as well who are expecting a 1:1 remake instead of doing new things and then just updating the graphics",pokemon
"in an interview it was confirmed that the orre region is based off Phoenix Arizona. and iirc the unovan region is suppose to be based off new york, not 100% sure on that second part though","Exactly, which is why I thought it would make sense for them to be closer on the main map, or at least part of the same continent. I wasn’t actually aware that Unova was based strictly on New York, which is actually quite interesting! I always thought it was an amalgamation of the US.",pokemon
"Well if we map the Pokémon regions to the real world, New York City and Arizona aren't *that* close. The USA is big.

Still closer to each other than any other regions. (Well, unless NYC is actually closer to France than Arizona, I haven't measured.)","I wasn’t actually aware at the time that Unova was based strictly on New York City, which is quite fascinating! This means it would most likely still be on the same continent, but still a fair distance away. 

The most interesting takeaway from this is that it opens the possibility for each US state to be their own Pokemon Region, which is supported with Alola’s inclusion too... How interesting! 

(Also, after looking it up, indeed, Phoenix is closer to New York than France, by about 1300 miles or so. Still quite the distance though!)",pokemon

"ngl untill we see more gameplay footage im not that excited for legends right now. we know you can catch and battle wild pokemon, gonna need to see more than that before i can get excited for the game","The thing that would actually get me excited is seeing an actual living Pokémon world. 

I’m talking about magikarp swimming in packs, slowpoke fishing for shelder, Lotads floating in ponds, flying Pokémon in the sky, etc. That is the Pokémon game dream. if it was like BOTW but instead of you climbing/surfing/flying it would be the model of the Pokémon you caught that can do those things. Also Pokémon reacting to your presence in friendly or territorial behaviors. Give us a world to explore and be lost in

So far I doubt that this game is like that given the shinx totally standing unaware of its friend being captured, other Pokémon standing around not interacting with the environment. It feels like it’s just the models placed in the world to capture or battle

"You do have some amazing ideas, but sadly Masuda said they are making Pokemon games more and more simple/easy because, apparently, a world renown multi million franchise needs to compete against mobile gacha games, so I don't see them doing something different. They did the bare minumum with Sw&Sh and sold more than 20 million units, why do something better? So, We either move on to other monster catching franchises (Digimon has been doing a great job lately) or just get used to what Pokemon is now.

\*new Megas,"I think like maybe 10 new megas with one for giratina and 1 for each of the starters so that's 6 left over for just choice sinnoh pokémon (maybe even a few less in total depending on balance issues), primal/origin forms for box legendaries, a delta episode kind of deal for Arceus or Giratina and no dexit. If it had all of those things, every person who dislikes the art would easily be sold and would learn to live with it. I know I would. I think people would even forgive not having trainer customisation (since Dawn and Lucas already have set designs) with that kind of content.

That sounds like a lot of work -- and I'm sure it is, especially for an outsourced development team -- but most of the world and the characters, town and route design layouts, trainer teams, gym teams and the dialogue, etc. have already been designed 13 years ago so I imagine that saves a bit of time to not have to redesign most of those from scratch.

I recognise this is literally ""just ORAS but for D/P/Pl"" but frankly I think that's what people wanted -- ORAS may not have been perfect, and the Battle Frontier thing was stupid and ""people lose focus"" was a piss-poor excuse -- but they were still great games with a lot of content (even if the post-game was lacking without Battle Frontier). Yellow was my first game as a kid, but I never played Gen 2 at all; Ruby and Emerald were the primary pokémon games of my childhood and ORAS was a fantastic rebirth of nostalgia for me. I think most people wanted the same as I got for ORAS but applied to Diamond and Pearl (or more accurately Platinum). Diamond was a pretty big part of my childhood too so I won't deny being pretty invested in these remakes being good too.

I miss Z moves too but I don't expect to ever see them again, which is very saddening. I miss 10,000,000 Volt and Catastropika and so forth.",pokemon

She only appeared in the Platinum game",pokemon
"I'm going to just...not buy Diamond and Pearl remakes.

1. I don't really like DPP to begin with.

2. I really wasn't happy with Sword and Shield. Only way Gamefreak/Nintendo will learn and improve from their mistakes is if people stop buying their games.

Like, I just don't trust Pokemon anymore. I have 0 faith. Like, ""Oh boy, Megas are coming back! I can't wait for them to get removed again later down the line and replaced by a shittier mechanic!""","I mean, yeah. The issue is that people won't stop buying. Reality is, it's not just about how good the games are any more. Hasn't been for a long time. The userbase is just too big to crack unless GF cataclysmically drops the ball. Even then, a good chunk of people will defend it. Because it isn't just about the games any more. It's about community. Being a Pokémon fan is an 'identity'. It makes you part of an 'in-group'. And to some people, that's more important than the actual quality of the games. There's nothing wrong with it, it is what it is, but it's the reason GF is able to get away with as much as it has. 

I'm a huge Sinnoh fan, and I'm super disappointed that we won't ever be getting modernised remakes in the same vein that Kanto, Johto and Hoenn got. In my case, the originals look leagues better than the remakes. The chibi style is incredibly off-putting in 3D. Not only that, but the proportions are nowhere near the same as they were in the originals, so the chibi aesthetic isn't even faithful. Seems obvious to me that GF chose that style because it'd be easier for another studio to translate to 3D and pump out for the holiday deadline. 

I'm personally hoping that these games don't sell nearly as well as Sw/Sh and GF realises that they can't release absolutely \_anything\_ and receive massive success, but... I'm not extremely hopeful. It's a shame, but it is what it is.",pokemon
GF isn't getting my money. Feel burnt.,What if Legends and DP are redeemable tho?,pokemon
"I’m not sure why everyone dislikes the style, I actually am excited for it.

Though with a healthy dose of skepticism, I’ve been burned before.","I’m personally just not a fan of it. If on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is hatred, 5 is true neutral, and 10 is adoration, I’m prolly a solid 2.5 or 3.

the proportions and eyes give me very adult baby funko pop vibes that kind of creep me out to be honest. I appreciate what they’re going for but I don’t personally think chibi works very well in 3d since it slips into the uncanny valley much easier.

I’d’ve much preferred a more proportioned take on it. A Sinnoh with properly proportioned characters and routes haha.

Though I recognize that’s just my opinion and many other people may find it perfect the way it is. At the end of the day, like this post says, if it’s good enough gameplay-wise, I’ll end up getting it; though it’s definitely not a day 1 purchase for me at least.",pokemon
"I wouldn't be over the moon if they added megas. Say what you will about Dynamax and Z moves, but at the very least, everyone got in on the fun.","I personally think Quality > Quantity

Yeah, less Pokémon get cool new forms overall with megas, but they’re all (barring personal opinion) high quality changes that make every pokémon drastically better.

Dynamax and Z-moves just feel generic and bland to allow for every Pokémon to be able to use them, which ends up feeling less fun to use, overall imo.",pokemon
Bruh I don't want megas,I wouldn’t mind Megas but gigsmax is just a stupid idea to begin with let alone actually do,pokemon
The remakes aren't getting megas... Where is that coming from lol... They'd have to go through and re do every battle in the game... That's not happening lol this is more of a 3d refresh/reskin. We MAY get some qol features such as no HMs but otherwise I wouldn't get your hopes up for these being that much different from the originals...  Idk maybe I'm wrong but they keep saying they want to keep it faithful to the OGs..,"wait what? why would they have to redo every battle? they don't even have to give the gyms megas, they could just be put in the postgame like in sun & moon

i really hope we are taking the ""faithful"" comment too seriously though, maybe they just emphasized that so people wouldn't be disappointed with legends? like ""here's the radically different sinnoh game, but don't worry, the traditional one is right here"".",pokemon

Anything from the 3DS or Switch era is going to be pretty grindless. In fact the community commonly complains about lack of harder difficulty options.,So i have new question: grindless pokemon game with fairly challenging difficulty.,pokemon
Let's go Pikachu or Eevee. The only downside to their grindless gameplay is there is no wild battles at all. It's only battles against trainers in the overworld. The game most like the traditional games with very little grinding is Sun and Moon or Sword and Shield. Since you like collecting things and such I suggest Sword and Shield.,"I have only 3ds, so Sun/moon is propably better option 😅",pokemon
"I would say that even gen 1 isn’t grindy if you use a small team. I remember playing for hours and hours because I would always have a team of 6 and try and keep them at the same level. You can get to the end quite quickly on a well-formed team of four in a lot of games

That’s doesn’t really answer your question though.... start with RBY.

"I remember seeing 
A post about 2 years ago when links awakening for switch was announced, being a chino version of Pokémon in that style. Everyone seemed to like that idea then. What’s changed now?","Links awakening was done well though. I think with this it really needs some polishing, I’d really like the chibi style if it was fixed a bit. Like, the hands are awkward and the weird waddling look to it. And I personally don’t like the facial expressions either. I’m hoping they at least fix small things like that cause I’m having a hard time warming up to it.

The other thing too that I think differs from links awakening is that pokemon remakes have always expanded on the source material. I can see why someone might not want the ORAS treatment with this game, but the thing is is that there’s always been minor additions not just to gameplay and such but the environment as well. When I saw the trailer, they showed enough of the map to assume that everything is exactly as was shown in the original game, just with the 3D graphics. Other remakes have taken stuff like that and put a new spin on it. 

For me, I grew up with gen 4 and I still play it from time to time. After ORAS came out I thought it’d be so cool if DPPT got the same treatment. On the switch too I thought there’s SO much room for interesting new things. I don’t even care about the whole chibi thing (though it does need polishing), I’m more disappointed about the map and layout being 100% the exact same with no real additions or reimaginings",pokemon
Haven’t most previous main games been the chibi style?,"I'd say only up until gen 3 could be considered chibi, gen 4+5 were small but more stylised with better proportions and gen 6 up is similar with the advantage of full 3d.",pokemon

But actually, ignoring the age theory, the Regis are just elemental golems anyways, and the idea that it has to be some sort of solid material is disproven with Regieleki's existence, so they might as well make a Regifire and a Regi for every type.","When does Gamefreak ever confirm anything to us 👀

I have grown to like the graphics (all the memes really helped) but I can not see me paying £60 ($80) for this game,is that what switch games normally are where you live? where I live it's normally $60.,pokemon
I'm /okay with the visuals. I can live with it. I feel it's just gonna be diamond and pearl with no HMs and reusable TMs.,"I am 99% certain HMs will stay. But with confirmed ""modern qol improvements"", I'll hope we get pc access like LGPE and SwSh which will at least make it tolerable.",pokemon
"For me it's the opposite. The more I look at the graphics, the more i hate it. I am someone that loves Chibi style games, and have no issue with the art direction. I never minded it in Final Fantasy spinoffs, nor did it ever bother me in games like Animal Crossing.

When Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl's trailer dropped, I found the graphics to be charming, and cute. It was a faithful remake after all. But the more I look at the graphics, the more obvious how much of a step backwards this is.

Let's Go Pikachu for its all its flaws, was a fair compromise between gorgeous HD graphics, while retaining the old pixel/cartoony style. It has lush lighting, shadows, and the trees/grass had depth.

I look at the Sinnoh remakes and I see none of that. I see oddly shaped character models where the head is massive, and they have tiny feet and no knees. I see characters stuck awkwardly in a t-pose.

Pull up Link's Awakening remake from 2019, and look at how insanely beautiful the chibi art style pops from the screen. I see none of that with D&P. The walking animation looks weird, the shaders look off, and the lighting is just plain ugly.

Game Freak pawned this game off to a 3rd party studio, who didnt use any of the current series engines. They chose to make a new one, and it looks objectively worse. I love the Chibi style, but I can't help but see this as a step backwards.",I think your comparison to Links Awakening is what just (ironically) woke me up to the issue. It's clear now that they aren't making the most of what's available to them.,pokemon
I want to love it. I really do. But I don’t.,"I'm waiting to see if there is new content, unless not really worth it...",pokemon
I've never owned Diamond/Pearl before so hopefully these remakes are as good as everyone says the originals were so I can enjoy them as much as they did,"Just for reference, when comparing D/P to Platinum most people would choose Platinum as the straight up better game. D/P are okay by themselves when looked at in a vacuum, though they do have their flaws, but when you look at Plat....yeah. Plat still has its flaws here and there, but imo between the original D/P and Plat it's no contest.

Time will tell just how faithful the D/P remakes are to specifically the original D/P. If ILCA ends up taking a lot of notes from Platinum (at bare minimum, at least regarding the dex) then I think they'll be good games, any gripes I may have about the chibi models aside. After that you add in Fairy type, expanded movesets, maybe Megas? etc. and they'll be good. But, again, we'll need to wait and see.",pokemon
"I think we should just be happy that the devs listened to the people that wanted the remakes and are doing what they wanted. Trying their best to keep the old style whilst mixing it with the new one, we just gotta give them a chance.","This isn't a good thing to say. We should have the right to expect quality work. Just because they're remakes doesn't mean they're good remakes or that they're making good decisions.

I should say I actually like the route they're taking, but I understand why people don't. People had more than enough reason to expect that the DPP remakes would be in the style of SwSh, that was how every other remake did it up until this point. People who are disappointed they didn't go that route are justified in feeling that way.",pokemon
I have a theory that there was plans for it to be released on mobile that’s why they chose that art style and why everything has a low polygon count,I doubt that theory,pokemon
"I can see why some people are upset with the style. Personally, even tho I am not a fan of chibbi, I am Just glad that they went with the faithful remake approuch. I Just cant imagine they making justice to Sinnoh in 3D. Same with Unova","Mad agree here, I think they could spruce up the lighting and outline the elements, but I absolutely love the Link's Awakening style ""block for block"" approach when it comes to the DS games, they're sacred, and we saw how much charm Hoenn lost on the 3DS",pokemon
what’s ILCA?,"Support stuido, they made Pokemon Home, they've also helped on titles from other series like Dragon Quest XI and NieR.",pokemon

"You can actually relive through those events without cheating. Heartgold, Soulsilver, Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Black, White, Black 2, and White 2. Just look up gen 4 and 5 exploits. These Pokémon are considered legit and can be transferred to Pokémon Home. 

And I agree. The minute that I heard that past events actually had a story line, I felt sad about how current events are given. I hope that with the remakes and Arceus, we can get better events.","I am using an emulator I'm afraid, all wireless connections are sadly inaccessible for me but I've accepted that, it just got me thinking about it is all",pokemon
"Iirc, the reason a lot of those events were scraped was because the outcry of people saying it was too confusing or hard to figure out what to do with the item to trigger the events then just be given a pokemon.  
  
Keep in mind, the target audience for this game is and will be young children. Giving them a flute or a letter and basically sending them off isn't the best guidance for getting those legendary pokemon.","I guess but even just a leaflet at the events with some instructions might be better than taking out the gameplay altogether.

"I think the thing that was the dumbest was Gigantamax specifically.

* Pokemon looks different because ????
* Oh wait it doesn't make them statistically any better than a vanilla Dynamax pokemon nor do they have a unique ability
* Only difference is one move (1) has a different effect than normal, with a different particle effect added in I guess

What was even the point? Just make more mega evolutions you cowards.","I also didn't like the Gigantamax designs as much as the Mega Evolution designs. I get that they're supposed to be giant monsters, but the designs are super static and don't look good for anything more than standing in place and firing off a few attacks.",pokemon
"Yup. And I have narrowed it down to three reasons:

1: Martin’s Solrock

2: You could never join online dens in time, and even then there would be people wasting the dynamax

3: It was basically just Z-Moves combined with Mega Evolution, both we’re already too overpowered.","Don’t forget being able to just casually eliminate any stat-changing moves and non-volatile status effects *without having to sacrifice a turn.*

Or damage gates + shields that make attack-focused Pokémon useless (because once their shields break, their defense drops so much that any decent tank can do enough damage to activate the next shields/KO). 

I was excited about being able to battle boss Pokémon with my friends, until I realized we either face damage gates + shields, or we have to do Dynamax Adventures and can’t use our actual Pokémon.",pokemon
I don’t like any of the mechanics added since gen 6.... i just want more evolutions not.... this.,"I didn’t mind Megas. It felt appropriate for third form Pokémon. However, Pokémon without a three stage evolution should have received additional evolutions first.",pokemon

Now I think it was pretty fun of an addition and made VGC more interesting.",pokemon
"I liked it at first, then grew to hate it because it made pokemon battles last longer and the ""raid"" battles were a joke. Even IF you found people to join it they almost never brought an appropriate pokemon.

IMO it was a good idea but executed as more of a ""6 year olds will love the chonk"" gimmick.  I wish it had been better and it leaves me with nothing but remorse for the money I spent on sword and shield (among other negative things).","I know! It frustrates me to no end that people refer to the entire Dynamax mechanic while ignoring the raid factor, which it is clear they were designed for. They just say “big Pokémon lazy idea” while ignoring that it was game freaks attempt to create an interesting, PVE experience that was brand new to Pokémon.

"I think all these gimmicks are bad for the games. If certain Pokémon need buffs then give them buffs. The precedent has already been set so why not buff Pokémon that are undeniably shitty and even nerf certain Pokémon that are just broken. You wanna give certain Pokémon the edge in competitive battle? Ok how about each evolution line gets its own unique move that it learns by leveling up. Maybe these moves have a unique effect? Maybe some moves have dual typing and are super powerful with only like 3pp to make it more strategic and balanced. There are so many better, cooler ideas than mega-evolutions, z-moves, or dynamax. Though I will concede and say megas have been the better of all the gimmicks, it just takes away from the Pokémon vibe for me. Yes I’ve played Gen six and heard the game’s explanation—it still feels out of place and frankly a little stupid. Yes I play competitive and realize megas make the meta a little more interesting, but I think there’s better options out there than any of these lame gimmicks. I mean this could be considered another lame gimmick but Pokémon fusions? A little impractical design wise but that’s been something people have pondered since the beginning of Pokémon. I’m just saying that the bar should aim higher.",Very compelling,pokemon
"I'm in the minority that thinks megas are slightly overrated. Mostly because they give a lot of them to already strong pokemon to make them stronger. If they do megas again, I wish they were given predominantly to weaker pokemon (like they did with bedrill and mawile) to make them viable. It just gets to a point otherwise where the only megas worth using are the ones given to really OP pokemon. Personally I enjoyed how dynamaxing played into raid battles and how any pokemon could use it. But those are just my opinions",Fair point. I feel like I’ve said fair point or valid point or something like that to everything in this post lol,pokemon
I actually really enjoyed dynamax it was nice to see a gimmick that made all pokemon viable especially compared to megas which became extremely boring really fast since only 2 or 3 of them were worth using which created a meta where people were only building teams around 2 or 3 pokemon which you saw every game.,True,pokemon
"Dynamax was okay, but hear me out on this. 

I think Z-Moves were the best gimmick mechanic they’ve added. They let the player, and in competitive, have a one round move with the potential to boost the mon, and take out the enemy.

Shit was wild, man.",pokemon
Mega evolutions >,Kinda true ngl,pokemon
"Nice music and pretty so I like it. The biggest advantage over megas is that it works for every pokemon, instead of buffing the underrated really weak pokemon like Charizard (TWICE) and other extremely weak pokemon like Salamence or Garchomp.",Regular charizard isn't exactly a powerhouse.,pokemon
"No joke, bring back megas and z moves.
They're much better.",Sure buddy,pokemon
I like dynamaxing it was like a good combination of megas and z moves,"It was cool, but giving a large amount of bonus hp and 3 z-moves more or less feels unhealthy competitively.

"All the once per battle mechanics have been horrible and unbalanced, megas, Z moves, or dynamax.

None of them should ever return.",They weren’t totally balanced but they weren’t too bad,pokemon

"Just wait, 15 years from now Sw/Sh will be people's nostalgia games and they'll be begging for remakes and new G-Max forms.",Lol mega’s 2.0,pokemon
Well at least it was better than z moves. The atmosphere it had in the stadiums was enjoyable but I think it still failed in regards to differentiating itself. It was just 3x hp and 3 turns of z moves.,2x but ic what you mean,pokemon

I like dynamax.  It  will be missed.,Rip dmax. If they just made gmax mons actually get stat boost like mega’s then maybe it would be more liked...,pokemon
"Totally disagree. Raids, and Dynamax Adventures specifically, is one of the best end game features we've ever gotten. I'd put it second behind the Battle Frontier and its successive iterations (like the Battle Tower)

My biggest issue with them is the connectivity/availability issue. It's frustrating to try and join a Raid battle that has already started/closed. Fortunately that issue doesn't exist in Dynamax Adventures.","Damn, I'd say raids (and probably Dynamax adventures) were the worst post-game additions. It's so boring and braindead to me. But I can see the replay value it adds if you do enjoy them. Just let me battle or capture a Pokémon the normal way, not all this extra shit that doesn't even make sense and is usually highly inconvenient.",pokemon
"Unpopular opinion :

Dynamax was better than megas and WAY more balanced as every Pokémon could use it.

Try to change my mind, you can't. I know Megas look cool...or something, but Dynamax is better in my opinion. I hate that people are booing non stop Sword and Shield for literally anything. The game is good, stop blaming it for nothing-","Ok, I'll try. I'll argue here why Dynamax are not balanced at all in competitive singles, and especially more broken than megas.  


So pokemon singles is a switch-heavy, prediction based and boost and item reliant game. Having double hp and being able to fire moves that also give you boosting allows for no risk (your glass cannons are not made of glass anymore) and not very predictable boosting, making the game more random.   


Moreover dynamax has a set of immunities (not possessed by megas) that render many counterplays futile: it is immune to forced switch mechanics (Roar, whirlwind, dragon tail, red card, etc), flinching and also encore. Especially encore and force switch are the most used counterplays to boosting, which now becomes unstoppable.

Another obvious point to notice is that megas need item to be used, so if your pokemon wants to mega it needs an item. Dynamax not only needs no item and is lethal comboed with weakness policy (once again boosting) and life orb. It also overrides some otherwise well balanced item mechanic: you can ignore choice items limitation.   


So in a game like singles the fact that any pokemon could boost, resist a hit, ignore condition at any time and sweep the game brings down the whole thing to a couple of 50/50s making the whole thing much less skill based.  


On the other hand it's easy to predict megas when seeing an opponent's team, their stats are better but most time not so broken (the main exceptions being Blazi, Ray and Mence. Kanga was nerfed) and are compensated by the lack of other item. Also megaevolving grants no other immunity, bonker move with stat boost, or unfair bulk.  


This is not just my opinion but the singles' community almost unanimous viewpoint, thus the ban of dynamax from singles' competitive on pokemon showdown",pokemon
"For me the thing are   
Megas: Creative, poorly implemented in the game, and most of them gave them to pokemon that were already good (yes i see you gengar, salamence and rayquaza), and some unbalanced  
Z moves: Creative, well implemented in the game, and every pokemon could use them, but there were some specific species that could use ""special Z moves"", and balanced  
Gigantamax: Lazy, well implemented in the game, every pokemon could use them, depending on the pokemon could be balanced or unbalanced",Gmax mons are pretty creative imo dmax was just scaled models,pokemon
I actually quite like dyna/gigantamax. At least I much prefer it over megas.,"Good for you, then!",pokemon
"The bosses and Dynamax Adventure is fun, but it should not be allowed to be used in normal battles.",It-it ISN'T.,pokemon
Oh boy is it really going away?,It wouldn’t fit in BDSP and it would make no sense in lore for it to be in legends arceus,pokemon
The not joking half is that Raids worked,Kekw,pokemon
"I think it would be fixed if only select Pokémon could do it, like a 3-turn mega-evolution. 

Maybe only Gigantamax forms?  They could help bring attention to some Pokemon like Butterfree for example. But if everyone can do it why should I go with Butterfree?",Or they could buff gmax so they get stat boost like mega’s too...,pokemon
a,B,pokemon
My main problem with Dynamax was how they handled what pokemon got a Gigantamax seriously who asked for Gmax Kingler and Gmax Butterfree just felt wrong because it should have gone to Frosmoth. The worst one has to be Gmax Charizard because it was legit just gen 1 pandering I would have preferred Leon's ace to be Dragapult with a gmax form.,Mhm every gmax was either gen 8 or gen 1 (besides garbordor but only cause it was oleana‘s ace,pokemon
"At the end of the day, I prefer Mega evolution to Dynamax. Namely because of Max Airstream, speed can be such a deciding factor in a battle, and now any Pokémon with a Flying type attack gotta go fast. 

I do think that this has allowed some Pokémon some space to shine on their own, and that’s good in its own right. Mega’s had a similar impact when it was introduced. 

I think, like with Z Crystals, blanket-mechanics might seem like a good idea for all Pokémon but not all Pokémon are of equal stats to receive equal benefits, if that makes sense.",Well wont Pokémon with lower stats either way will get shafted?,pokemon
I thought it was kinda cool. I just try to enjoy everything GF puts out tho so take my opinion lightly,I try to do that too! Your a kind sir:),pokemon
"stupid AI and the shield system all kinda stink in raids  
gmax forms are more poorly distributed then mega evos  
don't even get me started on how unbalanced it makes singles battles

but I wouldn't mind the raids coming back if they overhaul the system  
 i actually really like the idea of you and a team of trainers fighting a super pokemon for a chance to catch it, i'd be down for it coming back, just being exlusive to raids  
I feel dynamax is good idea and concept  
brought down by horrible execution  


actually..... that might be good way to describe swsh as a whole",And if dmax was exclusive to raids I would also like to see it come back,pokemon

"I don't like that it has to be done in every battle. If it was optional, it would be different.",I feel like a lot of Pokemon's problems would be solved if they made certain aspects optional lol,pokemon
"I know that Pokemon is for kids and logic is irrelevant but its still burns in the eyes when you dynamax your pokemon and it will not squash the both trainers because ""Pokemon"".",Lol,pokemon
"I hate how faillsafe it was in battle... 
U get encored into dragon dance? Just dynamax...
U get yawned? Dynamax.
Fake out potential? Dynamax.
Oh your only counter move against me is based on weight? Dynamax.
My sweeper got toxiced? Guess i'll take the double hp so that even life orb damage is halved.
I got choice - locked? Dynamax...",All of those are true besides yawn. You still can fall asleep while dmax with yawn (I think???),pokemon
"The concept was cool, but the execution was painfully bad",Mhm,pokemon
This post was made by the mega evolution gang,I’m not apart of the mega evolution gang actually,pokemon
What did you do to jo king and where is his other half,Lol,pokemon
I don't get why every region needs to have it's own mechanic nowadays. It got so boring. Mega Evolution >>> because it was just awesome to some Pokemons that weren't as loved getting some love abd combined with the fairy type pokemon it was smth new,Sure but a lot of Pokémon who deserved them didnt get any and the Pokémon who did got mega’s were useless compared to better mega’s,pokemon
"This is a fresh start for pokemon

What if we could go without gimmicks until the eventual x/y remakes","Nah we’re getting mega’s in dp remakes, I’m sure of it",pokemon
I disagree,Ok.,pokemon
everyone except competitive players,Lol facts,pokemon
"I have my opinion, you have yours mate.",Exactly,pokemon
"I didn't mind dynamax, it wasn't too painful. The only painful part is how the story shoves it down your throat like they did with mega-evolution in x and y",Uhh there was only like three mega evolution battles in xy...,pokemon
"It’s not a bad mechanic,
It’s just kind of dumb tho",Yessir,pokemon
"100% not joking, hated that nonsense. Competitive gameplay was a 100% joke this gen.",Dmax was probably the most balanced out of the three mechanics ngl,pokemon
"Dynamax had some good ideas. If Mega Evolution comes back I think it should have a limited number of turns like Dynamaxing does.

From an aesthetic standpoint I wish that they had re-used Mega Evolution models for Pokemon that used to have them. I would D-Max my shiny Gardevoir all the time if it looked like its Mega Evolution.",I don’t think they’ll just retcon how mega’s work,pokemon
We all know it was just a new gimmick to sell the game to kids.,I think it was more then that at least but ok,pokemon
But... I liked it.....,That’s ok. I’m not shaming anybody who does like it.,pokemon
"Ah yes, the daily ""Gen 8 bad, upvotes to the left"" post. How original.",I didn’t say gen 8 was bad I’m just saying that the community didn’t like it very much. I personally thought it was pretty ok.,pokemon
I’ll miss that my favorite Pokémon had a g max form but I don’t care about the rest,Fair,pokemon
"The only good thing to come from dynamax was the gym battle theme.

As for the barriers and shockwaves in max raid battles...",Sure,pokemon
"I always liked megas over Dmax because megas gave a boost to a ton of non-legendary pokemon (fuck Groudon/Kyogre though), and created a ton of different competitive comps. 

This is also me being biased, but I also like no Dmax because I always run weather teams, and it's harder to keep a consistent weather team against a pokemon that can change it 3 turns in a row with moves.",Fair enough,pokemon
Didn’t like dynamaxing but I also don’t like mega evolves. Too digimon-y for me.,Ok fair enough,pokemon
"I liked the idea of Dynamax when it was first revealed. Kaiju Pokemon battles? Yes, please! Then I actually played the game and HATED it. I loved Megas, but didn't like Z-moves. Dynamax/Gigantimax was a combination of both, but worse. I don't want all of my attacks changed to worse Z-moves. I want the stat and ability changes of Megas. 

Admittedly, I don't know anything about game balance or meta. I don't know if Dynamax is healthier or the meta or something. I just know I absolutely do not enjoy it, and that's what matters to me. I also hate that so many Pokemon I bred and raised in gen 6 and 7 are kind of useless because I specifically built them for their Megas.",Ok fair,pokemon
"Z-moves as well.  I guess it kinda made sense with the material, but mega evolution was still better.",That’s your opinion,pokemon
"It was the same way with Megas, everyone hated it until it was gone",Exactly,pokemon
"The other games at least made an attempt to explain their unique mechanics in a way that made sort of sense...in this game it was just ""oh yeah there's these weird particles that exist since hundrets of years but you never heard of them and to use them you need a literal shooting star to almost hit you.""",Sure...,pokemon
I love dynamaxing,Good for you. I won’t judge,pokemon
"I've been playing a lot of Gen 7 Battle Factory recently and it really made me miss both Z moves and megas. Z moves made teambuilding super unpredictable and fun, while megas granted Pokemon completely new roles and niches in different metas.

They also both made Knock Off so much weaker because there was usually 1/3 of a team who was effectively immune to it. Contrast that with the state of Gen 8 metas where Heavy Duty Boots are the preferred item for 1/3 a team and it's obvious why Knock Off is so fckin annoying this gen",Yeh I agree,pokemon
"Mega evolutions felt natural and connected, and had an element of strategy. I'd love to see more of them.",Same,pokemon
"So do we think gmax is going with DP remakes? Hopefully so, such a gimmicky boring mechanic. Here’s hoping they bring back megas, perhaps the new gmax forms could become megas?",I think they’re just going to leave gmax in galar and just resurge mega’s naturaly,pokemon
I didn’t mind this! I liked it more than mega evolutions,Ok fair enough,pokemon
Do one for z-moves,Sure,pokemon
Better than Z moves!,Maybe,pokemon
Dynamax sucks but I hope they will keep Gigantamax. It’s very similar to mega evolution and some gigantamax are very cool,"Gmax are just dmax with a singular move difference, and how would they bring one and not the other?",pokemon
"I think dynamax was cool in the story (the battles, not the lore. The lore sucked) But in online/competitive/showdown, it's terrible. There's no strategy behind it, it's a panic button and gigantamax doesn't do anything at all",Lol true. And if you look into the lore it’s pretty interesting actually,pokemon
"Dynamax was awesome.
I really don't get why people say it sucks.
Also I only played Sword so I didn't experience the other battle mechanics",Ik people always hating on dmax (this meme is representing the community not what I think btw),pokemon
better than z moves,Why does everybody say this. Whatever sure that’s your opinion,pokemon
"I liked it, would I take it over mega evos? Nope! But it is a fun little thing",Same tbh,pokemon
"Is it weird that I feel that Mega Evolution fells less like a gimmick for one game and more like a feature of the series that was removed, but Z-Moves and Dynamaxing just feel like gimmicks to me.",Fair enough,pokemon
"I liked it, but raids weren't that cool",Yeh dmax adventures were cool though,pokemon
It will forever be in Pokémon masters ex I think tho,Oh yeh true,pokemon
I like Dynamax. Never enjoyed mega evolutions as no trainer ever seemed to use it. Plus with it lasting the whole match it made it far to easy. At least with Dynamax there is a bit of strategy where it only lasts 3 turns.,"Yeh totally agree. Only like three trainers used mega’s in xy, and one of them wasn’t even a real battle",pokemon
Wait is it confirmed to not be in DP remakes?,No but mega’s are already leaked so dmax is very unlikely,pokemon
I mean z crystals were worse,"Omfg this 20th one... ok well that’s your opinion, who am I to judge...",pokemon
I would have been fully on board if GMax pokemon were not in almost every case worse than regular. Otherwise I kind of liked it.,Yeh 99% of the time the gmax move has a worst effect then the regular max move,pokemon
"I only liked dynamax because of the gigantamax forms.
But imagine if the Gigantamax forms were repurposed as new Megas.",Minus Those that already have Mega evolutions.,pokemon
I thought they were alright. Not as good as Megas but I liked them more than Zmoves.,Same tbh,pokemon
Guess I'm the only person who liked the mechanic 🥲,"I’m just saying that most of the community didn’t like it. I kinda liked it, (also there’s like 30 other comments saying this exact same thing so your not alone)",pokemon
Still much more balanced than megas,Yep,pokemon
I like how they added more details to the bigger Pokémon,True,pokemon
only fun in the tcg,Yeh definitely,pokemon
It was...fine...or something.,That’s a very good way to describe it,pokemon
"I kinda liked it, but it got old fast I have to admit",Yeh,pokemon
I liked it,Good for you,pokemon
"I appreciate the half joke. I like dynamax because it's silly. Sometimes a silly mechanic can be fun, if only because it makes me smile to see a ridiculously sized pokemon. The gigantamax forms are cool too!

Maybe I'll need to replay XY again but I remember disliking mega evolutions because of how sad the pokedex entries were for the megas.

I can't remember what the thing was for S/M. Dancing...? Some kind of watch with crystal thing...? It was cute but didn't stick out to me.",Z crystals and yeh mega dex entries were a capital D Depresing,pokemon
It was pretty decent.,Yeah,pokemon
Dynamax was pretty dumb and pointless overall but it gave us chunky Pikachu so I can't complain.,Lol,pokemon
Dynamax was good and I enjoyed (more than megas cause at least it wasn't broken) please don't attack me,Yeh it wasn’t bad tbh but it could be better,pokemon
I want to see some of the G-Max forms return as megas,Don’t think that’ll happen but we’ll see,pokemon
"At first I was excited for Dynamax because I could recreate Kaiju battles.  


The ones in the stadium are pretty cool. You get more of a sense of scale with the stadium.  
But considering the majority of your dynamax experiences are in the raid, it gets kind of bland. I wish you could see more location damage.  


I dunno how to explain it, but there's a difference between making something look big, and making the other thing look small. Dynamax kind just made everyone else feel small for me.   
And if both pokemon are dynamaxed.. it's just a normal pokemon battle since no real location for comparison.",Yeh,pokemon
Dynamax wasn't as good as Mega Evolutions but was infinitely better than Z moves in my opinion,Agree to disagree,pokemon
"Regional forms are the coolest things they have come up with. I hope they can commit to making great variants for the next games, instead of a random new mechanic that only alters a few things. I like megas, but have a feeling they won't be coming back.",We’re not getting variants until like gen 9 but yeh regional variants were the best new thing game freak has ever done,pokemon
So I hate it as a mechanic but love it as a sort boss thing. It does not feel fun or really rewarding to use but I really like the raid dens being a thing. The raid dens made be play a lot more before I bothered to continue in the game like I would spend hours basically running around before getting a badge. Granted the fact that you need a Pokémon to Dynamax to break the shields in a decent amount of time is a bit annoying.,This is basically how I feel about it,pokemon
I mean.... Dynamax could be in the remakes. I honestly expect it to show up latest in post game. After all Its still gen 8,considering their attempt to be 'faithful' to the point that they didn't even give Dawn/Lucas new outfits tells me there won't actually be anything new to find.,pokemon
i like dynamax,Good for you. Who am I to judge,pokemon
I liked it.,Good for you.,pokemon
I prefer Z moves and Mega Evolutions than Dynamax,"So do I, ngl",pokemon
I’ve had to adapt to a lot as a fan for 25 years but this is indeed the dumbest thing without a doubt lol I don’t even know the difference between gigantimax and dynamax,Lel it just changes one move and that’s it. Pretty lackluster.,pokemon
Mega evolution made sense atleast.. it is the only mechanic we all wish could return,Lol most of us anyways,pokemon
"Z-moves were better than dynamax.

Change my mind",Can’t argue with that,pokemon
"Can't wait for dynamaxing to be a few years old so we're all circlejerking how good it was - you know, the exact thing that happened with mega evos",Yeh lel,pokemon
"I liked Dyna. Go ahead, hate me if you wish","That’s fine, idc if you like dmax then good for you.",pokemon
Not as hated as Z-moves,"Rip Z moves, gets way too much hate.",pokemon
"Dynamax had potential to be better than Mega Evolution, but was poorly implemented, I think.

Mega Evolution was cool, but only if a Pokemon you liked had a Mega Evolution. And while there were a lot of cool Megas, as they say, ""Every Pokemon is someone's favorite."" So, not everyone got to see their favorites do the cool thing.

Dynamax had the potential to fix this: Every Pokemon can Dynamax, so everyone's favorite Pokemon can do the cool thing. But, G-Max is a thing, which went back the other way. And also, Dynamax's mechanics really favored using it on certain types of Pokemon over others in a massive way.

It could have been the mechanic to let everyone use their favorite Pokemon in a super cool way. But, it didn't hit that mark.",Mhm,pokemon
Dynamax was more or less ok... But Gigantamax... lmao,Gigantamax was way more lax luster then it should have been,pokemon
"Dynamax was shit from basically every stand point. 

Aesthetically it was “Pokémon BIG” it wasn’t an impressive jump or change for almost any even G Max Pokémon who got short shafted proper forms that would’ve been cooler as Megas and not covered with that weird particle and cloud shit. 

Competitively in singles it was BUSTED broken I used to enjoy a single battle but nope not anymore. Gyrados and Corviknight and Lapras D and G Max’s were essentially all you saw at first then it became just Weakness Policy Ttar or Togekiss yawn. 

Story and lore wise it’s.... energy from another world made Pokémon big? Okay.",Ok buddy.,pokemon
I love dynamax,Good for you,pokemon
Mega evolution gang was here,Lol,pokemon
"God, Dynamax feels like such a nothing mechanic, you double your HP, the rest of your stats stay the same, and your moves only get slightly stronger, retain the same damage value, or somehow become WEAKER, and if an enemy checks you while you're normal size, being Dynamaxed isn't going to change anything",True,pokemon
this is how i feel about megas. never liked them,Fair enough,pokemon
Better than Z moves. Thats just me though,Fair enough,pokemon
Dynamax is great,I didn’t say it was bad just that nobody liked it.,pokemon
"(Same is true for mega evolutions, which are also really dumb)",Mhm,pokemon
"It was fine. I just wish they did a better job with Gmax to give it a more unique feel than ""Who do I max airstream with?""",Very true,pokemon
[removed],Lol,pokemon
"I actually liked it, and think it's more balanced than mega's or Z-moves. Hear me out, please. You could just mega evolve in any battle and destroy them. Same with z-moves, they were a nuke button. But anytime you can dynamax, the ai can too. It also has a short time limit, so you can't sweep a entire team with it. I do agree with u/[Chemical-Cat](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chemical-Cat/) about G-max, though.",Valid,pokemon
If you aren't a fan of kaijus like Godzilla gojira kong or mothra you just won't understand why dmax is cool.,Yeh,pokemon
"Mom, can we have mega evolutions!

No son, we have mega evolutions at home.

Mega evolutions at home:",:gigantimax,pokemon
I liked it more than z moves at least,In a mechanical standpoint yeah,pokemon
Even dumber was Z-Moves imho,Sure,pokemon
Forreal,Mhm,pokemon
Better than lame ass z moves,I mean yeah they made competitive a complete mess but they weren't all that bad. They had the fun dance concept and I can respect that.,pokemon
But the pokeyman gats BIGGUR isnt that so cool now by game for $60 with $30 dlcs,Dmax wasn’t the only think in SwSh,pokemon
"I prefer my battles with 0 gimmicks. No Dynamax, no Z moves, and no megas.",Fair enough,pokemon
I liked Dynamax 😳,Good for you. I’m not going to judge,pokemon
"Rhydon,Gulpin,Slugma and Swello...

"Pikachu, Pikachu, Pikachu and Pikachu.","Nah, one of em is charizard",pokemon

This legit does not make sense to me.",pokemon
Looks like a regional salandit,Someone on the Twitch stream said the same thing lol. The next stage diverges quite a bit.,pokemon
Cool but honestly i think it looks more like a Flareon.,"now that you mention it, yeah pretty much",pokemon
I have that chonky Pikachu too! Is it actually over 100 dollars?,Apparently!,pokemon
"Did you look at eBay sold listings? Pikachu goes for $5-$10, not over $100. Even if it was graded, PSA 9 Mint copies go for ~$50. Mewtwo goes for ~$30 at the same grade (9), and sold listings on eBay for the raw card are ~$5. Charizard is worth about the same if the condition isn't great, possibly just a bit more due to being Charizard, but not anywhere near $100.","Ok, thank you for the info!",pokemon
Krakle could be his evolved form. He could take over the shell of electrode,Its gonna be sick :D,pokemon

I loved those games, lol.","That’s exactly what it is haha

I love those games as well, but sadly I lost those cartridges :(",pokemon
I... Would unironically *love* this.  They're adorable.,"Haha, agreed!",pokemon
I hate it...but some people enjoy it so that's good.,"I like that Nintendo is trying to keep the nostalgic feel for players that really connected with the gen, and are making Pokémon legends for fans of what’s to come!",pokemon
This is either a horrible joke or a woosh moment for me because this makes no sense. There shouldn't be any newer Pokemon in the then section and shouldn't be any gen 1 pokemon in the now section.,You wooshed,pokemon
"Both sides are of mixed gens though- like newer ones are also on the left and some older ones on the right, so not truly a chronological seperation","Thats the point, every generation has stinkers and badassery.",pokemon
Some of the Pokémon on the right are older Pokémon and some of the ones on the left are newer lol,"Exactly the point, *every* generation has total badasses and total duds.",pokemon
"Are people expecting it to?! It’s not the traditional “Catch ‘em All” type game at all, from what we know of it thus far - admittedly not that much.","I saw someone in another post express that they wanted every pokemon in it, so I decided to make this post lol.  I don't think people have thought about it much so far, but I'm worried there are people that might expect it without understanding why they shouldn't.",pokemon
"I mean it’s mentioned that people from other regions bring non native Pokémon to Sinnoh to help with their work or as pets (like the starters) so while there likely won’t be any wild Pokémon from Gen 5+ you’ll probably be able to obtain some from people as gifts or something. Like maybe they could do the “500 for this magikarp” thing but with a wimpod 🤷🏻‍♂️

Edit: definitely no national dex but I think they’ll add some Pokémon from other regions to spice things up","Yeah I think its possible that we could get 1 or 2 more in the form of a trade or something, but I wouldnt exactly say its likely.  I just rewatched the 25th anniversary livestream, and reread the website info.  It doesnt say anything about people from other regions bringing non native Pokemon to Sinnoh to help with their work as pets.  Unless I'm missing some extra info that was given, but I don't think I did.  Pokeballs are also likely a new concept, so idk it might not be likely.  Even the art shown in the trailer of the town, with people walking through it, didnt show a single Pokemon amongst those people.",pokemon
"To clear the air, I'm totally on board with not every Pokemon showing up, but I think you might be crossing more possibilities off the list than you need to. Like, the fact that they're immediately throwing Oshawott and Rowlet in our faces in the trailer feels like a *pretty* clear indication we could see a wider variety than we expect-- who's to say these are the *only* pokemon this mystery individual brought with them, or that they're the only one doing so? Moreover, I think a lot of people are getting a little hung up on the Darwinian 'diversity of life' thing and how being set in the past affects the pokemon diversity. (Good chance we'll see Rotom in one way or another, even though none of its current forms could even *exist* in this time period, haha) Basically, they're free to do *literally* whatever they feel with the lineup in this game, and it only takes a single sentence of ret-con writing to make it work. They chose these starters because they're popular, and they know it's a selling point that you might get some surprise appearance from later gens-- basically, i think these starters are specifically *intended* to indicate some later gens could make an appearance and get people hyped about that, because it's the more flexible Sinnoh game happening right after the remakes, which *definitely* won't be extending beyond Gen 4.

I think it's also a stretch to suggest that we're definitively the 'first' and only trainer, even if they've stated that trainers aren't a thing yet. Like, Pokeballs already exist, and some unknown character clearly understands the concept of a starter pokemon-- unless this person is also the first to *invent* pokeballs and we are *literally* the first person on the planet to ever catch one (which would be AWESOME as a plotline, ngl) it's probably safe to assume there's others out there doing the same thing, we're just the first to try and compile them all as a pokedex. I'll admit, it could go either way-- I just think the writers are a little too attached to antagonists and rival characters to let go of trainer battles entirely, and it's certainly not too much work to have the same battle tech with a second NPC standing across from you.

On a similar note I'm kinda undecided on the multiplayer thing-- I wouldn't expect the level of it that we had in Sword/Shield, and I don't *personally* care for PVP anything, but it does make them more money to have people trying to find friends to trade with, or buy Pokemon Home subscriptions to swap pokemon in and out. In general, it seems like any game that's involved jrpg style battling (Colosseum, XD, Go, Let's Go) has always put in *some* kind of feature for moving pokemon in and out, cuz it helps them sell other games-- not having it wouldn't be a deal breaker for me, but I don't think anything about the world lore/time period would inherently cross it off the list.

All in all, I'm down for whatever this game has to offer, even if it's a more limited collectathon experience, but I think the marketing material we've gotten so far makes it pretty obvious they know people want to see more, and they'll be pushing it in that direction. *But*, Gamefreak's also never been the best at communication, so the starters could always be the biggest mixed-signal thing ever to show in the trailer, and Cyndaquil/Oshawott/Rowlet really will end up being the only non-sinnoh pokemon in the entire game, charizard be damned.","I find it so odd that you consider the 3 starters a mixed signal thing tbh.  In other games, the three starters you get are ""rare pokemon"".  In this, its outright stated these 3 specifically were brought from other regions.  I think you'd be reaching to think this would indicate we'd get more.  Keep in mind that this mysterious person, was still stated to be a Professor.  Its not a ""other people are bringing them over"" type thing.  In a world without trainers, people like Professors would be the ones doing this type of stuff.  Think for example, exotic species in our modern day.  People can not own them as pets, but those authorized can keep those that had been unintentionally imprinted as ambassadors for the species.  I imagine the Professor would be allowed to bring them over, because he is qualified to do so when there is no way to properly contain these creatures yet (Pokeballs).  On top of this, in previous games, Professors at best will give you a singular egg on top of your starters.  Or another set of starters after you finish the national dex.  I don't think its likely he just brought a shit ton of Pokemon over, its likely just these 3 and MAYBE like one more Pokemon to fill that ""egg"" spot.

Saying that there isnt a concept of trainers, seems to explicitly imply that Pokeballs are a brand new concept.  And considering your goal is to make the first ever Pokedex of the region (as was stated officially), itd make sense if you were given access to them on their first inception.

I feel like the way you conveyed a lot of your statements feels a bit like a reach with everything conveyed in the livestream/website.  It seems like a ""well technically we cant say definitively 100% that there won't be more.  Or that we're the firs trainer"" etc etc.  When theres a significantly larger amount of evidence in favor of the statements I made.    Also, Oshawott isnt even a popular Pokemon.  The starters were picked to fit a theme, not because they were popular.  I'm fine either way as well, but I think what I conveyed in this post is much more likely than the contrary.  Especially with how they responded to dexit backlash during sword and shield.  They said something along the lines of ""from now on, we'll only have a select group of pokemon available per game, and then in the next game you might see a DIFFERENT selection of Pokemon"".  It seems they kinda responded to dexit later on, by including a lot more pokemon down the line (although definitely not all of them).  But games like this are potentially what they have in mind for that type of philosophy.  Sure you could retcon stuff.  But thats just ignoring all the established reasoning in favor of ""well, you never know!"".

As for multiplayer and Pokemon Home, sword and shield still exist.  Diamond and Pearl remakes still exist.  And gen 9 will eventually still exist.  I think they might at best allow you to export Pokemon from Legends Arceus, but not import.",pokemon
This is cursed. Love it!,Thank you xD,pokemon

"I honestly dunno. As a kid I never really took the time to really care about the soundtrack for many games. It wasn't until I went back and played gen 4 that I was able to really appreciate the soundtrack. 🤔

I may have to go back and listen to it from time to time.","I would argue Gens 3,4, and 5 have the best soundtracks in the entire series.",pokemon
"FRLG’s music is definitely among the most grounded overall in the series. It comes across as very boring and tepid. No tracks will piss you off on their own, but there’s not many tracks overall, leading to repetition problems, and very few tracks come off as being that good.

The only tracks that I like in FRLG are the gym leader/champion battle music and some of the postgame tracks.

FRLG’s OST is a rare blemish in the OST department for GameFreak and is one of the only problems I have with this great game. 

This opinion doesn’t come from someone who  is lacking experience with FRLG either. It’s one of my favorite mainline Pokemon games, and it’s the game I have played the most as a teen/adult. I’m in a prime position to be nostalgic about this, but I’m not nostalgic for FRLG OST at all outside of a select few tracks.

Vs. Deoxys doesn’t count since most people didn’t get that event",Deoxys and Lavender Town are the only ones I really enjoy from FR/LG.The latter being the only track that's better than its original.,pokemon
"none of the games' soundtracks stand out as ""bad"" to me, but frlg was pitched up for some reason and it's weird. the champion theme was definitely better in the original

hgss' music was *way* more ""grand"" than gsc's, just look at new bark town. i liked it, but that's probably because i played it before the originals.

thinking of the newer ones, oras' surf theme is super different. i remember really liking it, but at the same time, it's just not the same as the original...i dunno. i like lavender town from let's go, but i feel like the rest of the ost is boring. every track is orchestrated, but it ends up way less punchy. kinda watery. idk how to describe it.

it seems like they're doing the same for bdsp as they did with let's go, which is kinda disappointing. the Opening Selection theme you can hear in pokemon presents just sounds...less good. less authentic? maybe it's just my nostalgia talking, but yeah","I think what you mean is that the music is now orchestrated and more techincally advanced, but in the translation it somehow lost the intense feeling that the music gave off. There was so much emotion in such simple sounds, small wonder the remakes couldn't recreate it.",pokemon
"This is something that’s always bugged me about Gen 3, the music always sounded so awful to me and I also always caught a lot of flack for that. Glad to see I am not the only one that feels this way.",My opinion on this matter only extends to FireRed and LeafGreen. I maintain my stance that Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald have some of the best music in the entire franchise.,pokemon

"I don’t think it’s underrated these days, but I do remember a lot of hate for it back in the day. I loved it though! Such fun cities to see and it really felt like it was pushing Pokémon graphics to a really pleasing level. I still miss animated sprites— they had so much personality!

Plus most of the Pokémon designs are really fantastic! Zoroark is my favorite Pokémon :)","Best looking Pokémon games imo, I would love gens 1-8 redone in this engine ahaha.",pokemon
"I agree with you. Don't get me wrong, Gen 5 is already pretty hyped up, but honestly it deserves more compared to what the other generations get. 

Especially since BW2 is always forgotten about too. It may not have the same great plot and story as the first, but it's still really good and adds a lot more new and interesting things, which is crazy considering it's the same region.",Yeah mainly BW2 is underrated but I also agree!,pokemon
Gen 5 changed a lot and I was a fan from the beginning. People are coming around to it now but I remember it getting severely dumped on. I’m playing through White 2 right now and I’m remembering exactly why I love it so much,White 2 is so good! The region is a lot better in it and the post game is fantastic. All the old Pokémon being in the game is great too.,pokemon
We’re never going to get Digimon survive though 😔 I will be really happy if it comes out eventually though,I think the new digimon story game might be teased this year,pokemon
"Digimon became on par with pokemon for me when I was a kid but I could never get into the games. They just didn't execute the ""feel"" like pokemon did.","Early digimon games had wildly inconsistent mechanics which meant that liking one game didn't always mean you'd like the next game. This is a problem when pokemon (let's be honest everyone is always going to compare them, regardless of if it's fair/valid to do so) pretty much nailed the core gameplay cycle from the get-go and then refined it with better balancing and added depth. The mechanics in digimon games still switch up a bit here and there but it's mostly separated into games in the 'Digimon World' series and games in the 'Digimon Story' series. 

If you are at all interested, the somewhat recent Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth games are imo by far the best digimon games to date and I much preferred them to the gen 7 pokemon games. I really enjoyed the characters and the story, the only major complaints I have about the games are that while the IRL Japan locations in the games look great, most of your actual gameplay takes place in cyberspace, and almost none in the Digital World, which is a missed opportunity since the Digital World has infinite potential for cool environment design. While cyber space looks fine, the environment becomes quite repetitive, which is a shame.",pokemon
I'm sure my bro had a pokemon monopoly ?,I never would have guessed that haha thanks! Seems very likely,pokemon

"Seems to make sense until the opponent uses it.

""This move hits 5 times.""",(2+5)/2=3.5. It all averages out in the end,pokemon
"You see Ivan, when Skill Link Cloyster with Icicle Spear is best comrade, you do not fear of losing comrade Cloyster because always hit 5 times and Chomp x4 weak to Ice!

"It'll only be good if they doing pokemon size scaling correctly, since it's open world.",So far so good with scaling.

"I mean obviously opinions are a thing, but fuck that’s a bad take x and y we’re definitely not perfect but they are definitely better than SwSh.","Always thought the X/Y hate was overblown. They were fairly underwhelming but otherwise pretty standard Pokemon games; definitely wouldn't put them at the top of my list or anything, but I thought they were a pretty solid transition to 3D.",pokemon
"GF put all their attention in mega evolution, then totally forgot to give the game any improvement Which is sad cuz Kalos was such a cool idea too :(","I mean X and Y were major technological jumps, not mention Kalos was really well implemented, as opposed to Galar which felt like a few super empty towns with a bunch of building cutouts.",pokemon
Pokemon Y was my first pokemon game so it holds a special place in my heart,"Thats fair. Wouldnt you like to see it again...

But better?",pokemon
"Genuinely bad?  

You must not have played SwSh then",I gave swsh a pass because i liked the dlcs.,pokemon
"A kalos remakes means new megas. Well its not guranteed that kalos remakes will give us new megas. But if we are ever going to see new megas its probably going to be in kalos remakes.

Meanwhile BDSPs core gameply revolves around fighting, and it's story sees terroristic threats made and acted upon, sees the world almost end, and, if they adapt platinum stuff too, sees a man carried off to hell by legally-not-the-devil.

I just don't think it fits.",You're exaggerating. They're both kids games. No one walks around saying pokemon is their favourite anti-terrorist game. Chibi fits now just as it did back then.,pokemon
"Everybody 100% expected SwSh graphics. That’s the only reason why people are so mad and don’t like the remakes. They can come up with whatever, but ultimately it’s because they won’t be seeing Sinnoh in SwSh style. Personally, not an issue at all to me. I skipped Gen 8, and it looks like I didn’t miss on anything.","That's not it. Some people expected SwSh, others fully expected a Let's Go style, and some people expected nothing at all. It's not necessarily ""it doesn't meet their expectations,"" though it is for some people. I, for one, mostly have issues with the proportions on the chibi models, shading and texturing on the full-sized models (especially compared to the environments they're placed in), and complete lack of innovation or creativity in re-imagining Sinnoh. Even Let's Go added cute little posters and had a unified shading and texturing style. If you look around, you'll see quite a lot of people admit that they're alright with an ORAS or LGPE art style, too. It not being SwSh style hardly matters to most people

I think they're sticking too close to the letter of Sinnoh instead of capturing the spirit of it, and the only thing that's shown otherwise to me is Mt. Coronet looming in the background of some of the battle environments. But one detail doesn't indicate much for the game as a whole",pokemon
"It's not about style, it's about quality of textures/light/shades. Same arguments goes to Links awakening. If BDSP is as of quality as either of the two I'm sure a lot of people including myself will be ok with it","Well... Some people don't like the style, or so i've heard.",pokemon
I hope none of that shit is in it,"After main story, most people keep playing pokemon games for shinies and competitive battles. They wouldn't remove the daycare.

"It’s really odd that the characters in Legends Arceus look so much like Lucas and Dawn. Subsequently a lot of fan art lately has just been Cynthia in cosplay as well. It all looks nice, but it’s pretty weird.","Its an animation trope (basically a running gag) in which the ancestors pretty much look like the same character just in old clothes. Basically one could easily try and actually create an ""actual ancestor"" but the joke is that since ancestors are the ones who we have to thank for us basically being alive then we try and imagine them as if they looked like ""us"". If you grew up with cartoons and anime I would be surprised you'd never seen this trope at least once.

I do love the fact this game will give you a selection of starters from a few regions. Great idea.,"I both like it and I both don't, I love all of these starters and I honestly think they fit the aesthetic perfectly well, but I was deep down hoping Id start this adventure with my beloved Turtwig, I feel like it may feel a bit different since you are probably given one of these at the start instead, and yes I can use it in the remakes, but there's just something slightly off here for me, but I'm really hoping all that will be just me being an idiot once the games release!

That's correct. This is an idea we've been toying with for a while and of course - it's always the extreme cases that kinda ruin it for everyone else. We've had complaints about the users that come into the subreddit to dump 10-20 memes, almost all of which are reposts or low-effort. 

This rule isn't set in stone, we just noticed there was a toggle in the mod tools on new Reddit to allow only one image/video per post so we figured we'd give it a shot.

"Tfw your party gets attacked by trolls

Tfw your aware of how they work

Tfw your currently being tortured and can't say anything, only look on in horror as a bunch of trolls and helmed horrors basically almost TPK the entire party.","I feel like trolls are probably common enough in most settings that your character has a decent chance of knowing how to kill them. Especially if you want to spin a yarn about the time your great-grandfather killed a troll with a candle or something like that.

Besides, puzzle box monsters aren't very fun if you know the answer but are trying not to metagame.",dndmemes
This is something my table has been having issues with. Even without metagaming you still KNOW. So I've been just changing them up a bit. Mummy lord now has resistance to fire damage because of an amulet but is vulnerable to psychic eyc.,"Been doing the same for my campaign.

Regular Lizardfolk wasn’t much of a challenge? Oh boy, here comes one with thicker scales and bigger muscles with a glimmer in his eye.

Decided that rare bloodlines of lizardfolk in our setting have a kind of “Gaze” that allows them to pinpoint weak spots on their target, always attacking advantage. Also made this one resistant to slashing/piercing damage as a result of his thicker scales, but still could be hurt normally with bludgeoning.

Each time that I’d roll and miss with him but roll again, inbetween I’d say, “You see an odd glimmer in the lizardfolk’s eye as he quickly alters his swing and (assuming it hits) slashes you with his sword.” They picked up on the clue and nailed a history check to remember this kind of bloodline. They successfully took out his eye specifically and took away his advantage.

So yeah, homebrewing/altering monsters is always a good solution to this problem.",dndmemes
"....And now they have to play a meta game around the fact that they know this extremely well-known monsters weakness, and have to do a stupid dance of not knowing it and avoiding any successful course of action.

I seriously hate it when people complain about PCs attacking trolls with fire. It's been a thing in the game since forever and it has featured in plenty of video games. When I encounter a troll with a new character, must I now stupidly swing my sword at the troll for the 7th time *again*? Can I never use the experience that I have? I'm fine with holding my tongue when in a group with new players, don't want to spoil things for them. But veteran groups *KNOW* it. And it's not ""roleplaying"" to pretend you don't know it. Any freedom of the game is immediately removed once you encounter a familiar monster; you're now in this stupid dance of only using ineffective methods. You can't even accidentally happen upon the right type of damage as you would if it *were* your first time, you'd get accused of ""mETaGAmE"". So you're locked into feigning incompetence, not as a character choice but out of ridiculous social pressure. There's absolutely zero fun in this.

You can easily work around ""the characters not knowing it"" by actually HAVING them know it. They don't leave in a vacuum, they grew up in the game world and undoubtedly heard old tales and warnings about various creatures. After all, we in the real world have tons of old tales and warnings about shit that *doesn't* even exist. You bet your ass my PCs grandmother would tell him to keep a torch lit when passing through the swamp to ward off the trolls.

The word ""metagame"" has become a trite curse upon the hobby, with people (especially here it seems, which also love to call any semblance of story ""railroading"") not even understanding what it is and the distinction between the good, the bad and the unavoidable.

If I see a troll, I'll bloody use fire. I've known it for decades now and I'm not going to pretend to rediscover it every single campaign or oneshot I play in ad nauseam","Ugh.  One particular player in a current campaign thinks ANY out of character discussion is meta gaming and brought his role play into a SPECIFICALLY out of character chat.  We have a couple new players that don't know how to read their character sheet, so they NEED out of character coaching and someone else to give them a hand. It's also a chance for the more experienced players to gripe about the DM invalidating our build choices and trying to deal with his outrageously difficult encounters where we make ZERO progress in multiple weeks.",dndmemes
instead of meta gaming our party just asks if it looks bloody when we attack somthing giving us a general idea of how close it is untill death,"I do the same in my games,  its a good way to let them know how the progress is going on the BBEG health.  The best is when a couple guys really lay into something and do a hundred or so damage and they ask, is it bloody and I give them the Cap ""I can do this all day"" bit.",dndmemes

Genuine mistake, but I wanted to introduce an NPC and this seemed like a good way to do it. One player chimes in ""I just looked up werewolves, how come the ranger's arrows are doing damage?"" Fuck off mate. 1) I'm the DM, I decide if it's resistant or immune, even if it was initially a mistake when I created the encounter. 2) Don't be googling monsters when you go into encounters or I'll be swapping in different creature stat blocks going forward.",dndmemes

"Sometimes metagaming is the only way to deal with bullshit. We were a party of five at lvl2 or 3. At the tail end of the session we encounter a group of goblins led by a nilbog, a second or third fight since the last rest. Now, regular gobos were going down at a reasonable pace, but the nilbog was reliably denying damage and dropped our barb with hideous laughter for a good while. Finally, only the nilbog remains and the five of us still could not make a dent in him! I manage to convince the DM to allow me a knowledge roll, and do well enough for him to allow me to look up the stat block. I don't pay attention to numbers and just abuse the wording about damage and tell the barb to grapple, tie up and gag the little bastard. We proceeded to drown him in a stream and end the session. On my way home I check the statblock again, just to see if there was a more elegant solution, and notice that it says DC 12 to damage and for it's spells. DM upped it to 16. Now, I don't mind spicing up the challenge, but this was just annoying.","That's a really weird way to go about it. As the DM I would given you in-character hints or have your character realise ""It only seems to charm it's attacker when the attacker's intent is to specifically damage it. Your allies circling and jockeying for positions around it threateningly don't seem to invoke the creature's effect."" 

Having a player look at the monster stat page is... immersion breaking, to say the least. Metagaming definitely isn't the solution, in my opinion.",dndmemes
"I've always never really understood why players read through the monster manual. It takes the surprise and stakes away from an encounter. That feeling of ""Need to be on our toes, we're not sure what this thing is capable of"" vanishes.

Whenever I've gotten the chance to play as opposed to DM (which is not often, fucking forever DM seat), I've always been dissapointed by the fact that I knew everything about the monster placed in front of us.","My players who have read the monster manual are either super interested in the lore and never metagame or are upcoming/current DMs that also try not to metagame. Although I definitely see where you are coming from. Unfortunately, my recall is atrocious so even if I read the stats, I’ll probably have forgotten them.",dndmemes

"Like running a ranger in ToA. Half the adventure is ""will they get lost in the jungle?""",Similarly for the middle parts of Frostmaiden. I had to let my arctic  ranger player know ahead of time that some of his abilities would be nerfed a bit just to make SOME tension in the exploration parts. He took it like a champ,dndmemes
"Just because you can't get lost doesn't mean you always succeed at finding the most efficient way to get somewhere, especially if you've got party members who are not as skilled at outdoorsmanship as a ranger. One person, no matter how skilled, can't completely carry the party on their back if the party members aren't pulling their own weight and supporting the ranger with good choices and decent ability checks.

It's only OP if you're not flexing your creativity as a DM and providing a rounded experience. Now, if you're just looking to have the party quick travel through the wilderness, then it's no big deal to handwave it off due to the ranger's abilities, just depends on what you're trying to achieve. Still, lots of fun RP opportunities that allow the ranger to use abilities often neglected in most campaigns, and take leadership of the group for a bit to get everyone through.","My take is the same. Your survival check determines what hex you wander into. Then the Ranger knows how to get back. He's never lost but sometimes he needs to wander around to realize ""this is not the way.""",dndmemes

"That would actually be a fair fight, seeing how Liopleurodons were smaller then Megaladons and enlarge would make them almost equal in size.","Come to think of it, that may not even be enough.

The most recent estimates of Megalodon put it at around 48 tons and 18 meters.

For Liopleurodon, the most recent study I've seen suggests a weight of 1.7 tons and a length of 7 meters. (It's a fairly gracile animal)

With enlarge, the creature's dimensions are doubled, and the weight octupled.

That would make it 14 meters and about 13.6 tons, just the right size to be a snack for a Megalodon.",dndmemes

It's like making a copy of a disc you own, you're entitled to it because you've already purchased it.","Depends on what company it is. If you wanted to buy the physical version of a book on Amazon, for example, you wouldn't then be able to get the digital version on DnD beyond, as the companies are separate and Beyond considers the digital versions as separate things. If a company sold both digital and physical books, you could probably be entitled to both. It likely just depends on the company though.",dndmemes

Do you want the physics nerd answer or the basic answer for earth?,"Okay, so, hypothetically, of course, say a PC is falling from a distance, d, given an acceleration due to gravity g, with an initial vertical velocity of 0, and the wizard isn't around to save them with feather fall. Now, say that same PC is equipped with a magic item that will allow them to instantaneously shift the force of gravity on themselves (and their quipped gear) in the opposite direction within a 60ft cube for one turn (up to 6 seconds). If the PC has built up some momentum falling, reversing the direction of the pull of gravity wouldn't immediately send the PC flying upwards. The PC would first slow down and eventually reach a velocity of 0 before moving upwards, so long as there's enough distance to fall left and the velocity of the PC at the time of magic activation isn't too great to be reversed by the new acceleration during the six seconds the magic lasts for. 

The thought experiment then is, given that distance, d, what is the point in time where the PC can activate the magic item so that their descent is slowed to a halt (or near halt) at the moment of impact if such a point in time exists for that fall distance?

The question being *ignored* is, would the PC without a big enough intelligence score to get into Wizard school be smart enough to figure out that point in time while actively plummeting towards the ground?",dndmemes
He isn’t even asking the bigger question: is the gravitational constant the same in this universe?,"Is that you, Q?",dndmemes

So... You got two potential sources for an interesting backstory, combat abilities that don't make you a killing machine but make sure that your character will be useful when it comes to that, and can describe yourself doing shit with your tail. No wonder people love this. It's maleable, relatively easy for begginers, and **T A I L**. 10/10 will play one of these someday.","Tieflings are basically just the current flavour of the month that replaced Drow as the Edgelord’s Favoured Race.

"Calm down satan, for real tho I had a player unintentionally do this. His name was Korac and we had both just been playing in a game with a character named Dorak. We just both had to accept that I was not only going to call him both names but also throw in Gorak and lorax because I could just never be sure.","Not to be That person, but if someone ever came to me with a character name that sounds even REMOTELY like a character from popular culture, and I made the connection at any point, that is permanently the name of their character in my mind.

"Tasha's buffed it pretty well, the beast master is still laughable but it's easy to homebrew fix that.",It's astounding to me that they just... forgot... to update the level 7 feature. They gave that stuff to the base beasts so now it's just a completely dead level. Luckily I have a DM open to tweaking/homebrew so it worked out but still. BM is more a trap than ever with all the early level tweaks it got.,dndmemes
"Honestly I don't think rangers of any subclass are that bad. But that's my opinion. I just think they have skills that are deliberately meant to be useful in specific settings and they're great for doing things in different ways than the simple ""go here kill.this"". But that also depends on the type of DM a party has and how much they want to utilize the rangers skill set.","I agree, the only real problem with ranger (other than some beast master stuff) is that their early level abilities in particular are a bit to precise to be useful. Their spells and subclasses are pretty good though.",dndmemes
"Should be be talking about 5.5e or 6e already? 3.5e Is still being played and 5e isn't even at it's prime I think... 

Instead we should be talking about good variant rangers for 5e.","I was thinking the same thing.  Why have people been dropping this shit idea into the world lately.  It's WAY too early for a new edition, especially when there isn't a pressing need for one, nor a set vision like 5e had (simplified gameplay with greater emphasis on roleplay)",dndmemes
"UA ranger, although it's pretty unofficial now, is a pretty good improvement for the ranger.","This! i ended up asking my DM if I could keep UA ranger, i dont like tasha's at all.",dndmemes
"The standard phb ranger is hot garbage, but the subclasses added in xanathars and tashas along with the buffs in tashas make it a viable class.","Definitely agree on xanathar’s and tashas helping with subclassesand extra features, but to me, the base class itself is still too flawed for me to want to play it outside of a flavorful one shot",dndmemes
"I think the best fix to Ranger is to massively expand Social Encounters and Exploration. I know there are extra rules in the DMG for stuff like this, but I mean hard, codified systems for exactly what people can do in social and exploration play. Then let the appropriate classes play with that a little. 

At the moment the ranger can make exploration kind of moot. “You never get lost unless magically misled” is cool but essentially neutralises the whole area that should be a ranger’s expertise. Instead, let Rangers go beyond what any other class can in Exploration. Let them find areas and track creatures that are literally impossible for other classes to follow. Give them options for different activities unavailable to other classes while travelling, such as snare-setting, track-wiping and other rangery stuff. 

For social play, let Bards spread rumours and gather information; get audiences that no other party member could due to reputation. Rogues could play as almost a hybrid Bard-Ranger, with some degree of extra Social skill but also being able to Explore more effectively than most in urban and dungeon environments. 

Of course, all this would require a bit of an overhaul on how adventures and scenarios are currently written for D&D, but I don’t want 6e to be “5th edition but even more streamlined/slightly improved”. I want 6e to be truly different, to expand and try different things. I know that’s unlikely to happen, given the success of 5e, but I can still dream.","I have to disagree. I don't like the idea that only certain classes are able to do those fairly generic actions. They should have bonuses to them yes, but making it exclusive can really stifle party diversity. We go back to the No Cleric No heal days basically but with more classes.",dndmemes
"I think that rangers should have a tribal subclass, giving them proficiency in spears, blowguns, immunity to most disease, and poisoners kit.","They are proficient in those things though. A spear is simple weapon and the blowgun is a martial ranged, same category as a longbow or crossbow. I'm not sure how disease immunity comes into play, just because you can track a dragon doesn't mean you can't catch syphilis

You can use a poisoners kit even without proficiency, but this is one thing I would talk to a dm about swapping an existing proficiency with the one you want",dndmemes
"Rangers really need a buff but the real question is what kinda role they should fullfill in the future? and what should their gimmick be?

atm they're like a shitty druid fighter that gets really nice spells they don't have the power to use properly. How would you like to play them though?","Yeah, one of the biggest issues I have with rangers as-is is that they effectively operate like a fighter/druid multiclass (with maybe a bit of rogue). That's fine and all, but like... if that's what I want, I could just play a fighter and take some levels in druid, or vice versa.

&#x200B;

I would love to see rangers function more like Aragorn from LOTR. Give them more viability in combat, let them interact with nature on a bigger scale, let them have better and/or more useful spells... there are a ton of ways to buff them. Looking at the Gloomstalker and the Scout Rogue, I think we can see a lot of what rangers should be. I'd like to see them as a more nature-y/survivalist fighter, but that's personally just me.",dndmemes
"Hot take, Ranger are and were better than most martials.","Now this just isn't true.
A barbarian can tank harder, a Rogue practically hemorrhages damage under the right circumstances, a monk has stunning strike and almost universally busted 17th level archetype features, and a fighter can take multiple actions in a round and has in-built self-recovery.
What can a Ranger do to close this gap? Even with Tasha's stuff making it better than it was, it doesn't really stack up to any of the other martials in any serviceable way in combat. It gets miniscule once-per-turn damage boosts and the ability to use Hunter's Mark, but those are pretty much where the combat benefits end for using the class. Its spell list is nice to have, I guess, but nothing there is really standout enough to bring it up to snuff and there's certainly nothing substantial for its combat ability on there other than Hunter's Mark and the capstone spells Steel Wind Strike and Swift Quiver, the former of which is a better spell for Wizards anyway. That's actually a repeating theme of Ranger spells in general, that you'd be better off playing a full caster with access to almost any given spell. This is all without acknowledging that almost no Ranger archetype comes with a substantial enough 11th level feature to justify locking one of the most important levels for any class behind archetype features, meaning that after this level Ranger is just outcompeted hard by virtually any class.",dndmemes
"Buff monks, rangers and wizards please. Theyre not awful but they could use a little love.",Replace wizards with sorcerers and you've sold me. Wizards have a million subclasses and even more spell options. Sorcerers get less spells known than many rangers with the right subclasses.,dndmemes
"Please stay away from doing half spellcaster BS

Ranger has potential to be actually good without needing to be given a shortened spell list, either make more spells that ranger could use at higher levels or make ranger have enough abilities on its own to be closer to a martial class

I hate how the half spellcaster system exists","I mean, Paladins and Artificers are able to work as half-casters. Why can't we have half-druids along with half-clerics and half-wizards? Unless of course you're implying Paladins and Artificers are also not well designed due to being half-casters.",dndmemes
"oh no please don't start a war, we just come from the snitties battlefield","The same was true for snitties, it's the same battle really.

"I’ve said the same thing here before about how it’s dumb that gnomes “have to have” prodigious noses as described in the official text, and it’s truly stupid how many people think otherwise. Same for tieflings that are different colors than described in the text, same for halflings that don’t have hairy feet.

"My party is almost entirely dwarves. I told them that it was up to them. There's still no clear decision on the issue.

I've already decided, as DM. I just haven't told them. 

All I feel about the wider matter is this: do you want a beard or not? Congratulations, you have one. Growing my own was hard enough, it shouldn't be trouble in a fantasy world.

Men can shave their beards so why cant women?,"This is the obvious solution, most people are just too salty to acknowledge it.",dndmemes
I usually rule it that dwarven women are naturally able to grow beards but it depends on their personal taste and the current fashion trends if they groom or shave their beard,"Love it.

"People are entitled to their preferences.

"I'm seeing a lot of people getting distracted from the point of the post. This, like ""snitties"" (I can't believe that word is in my vocabulary now), is about moral busybodies and their bigotry towards any creative choices they deem heretical which they subsequently harass others for preferring. They're to us what the ""D&D is satanic heresy"" group is/was to the D&D community only this group is, for the most part, actually in the  D&D community. Let people create whatever they want without having to deal with a mob of zealous bullies. If you see that happening, back the victim regardless of if you share their condemned preferences because what you do share is having preferences and the dislike of being harassed and bullied for them (or maybe you're into that kind of thing).

This is not about ""muh realism"" vs ""but what about dragons?"". They are both stupid arguments anyway.  ""muh realism"" doesn't mean creators shouldn't be able to create what they want without fear of harassment. ""but what about dragons?"" isn't an excuse for a creator breaking their own rules and failing to be internally consistent because they're lazy.","Yup.

"I actually had a player insist that the brutality of orcs was ""a manufactured stereotype created to promote racism and had no basis in reality""

(The fact she said ""reality"" as pertaining to *orcs* aka Fictional creatures was my first clue she was a tad leaky in the ol' brainpan.) 

To prove her point, she had her character attempt to negotiate with a band of marauding orcs who were doing the whole ""Steal the riches, plunder the womenfolk, burn everything else to the ground"" schtick.  

Completely unarmed. 

It. Did not. Go well.

She left the group caterwauling that I was deliberately punishing her for her beliefs. Which is a total fallacy.

I was punishing her for being *stupid*.

Point being that gatekeepers who get enraged by things like beardless Dwarven women tend to insist on the world conforming to what they believe it *should* be, not what it *is*.

"I am afraid of the amount of players who leave a game because the DM made a set character design for every race.

I give *some* dwarf women beards because *all* my characters are people who make decisions based on the cultures that have influenced them, not just the men.

"No that it matters, but I’m not even sure bearded dwarven women are cannon. The dwarven women in official art don’t have beards and the description in the PHB says nothing about women having beards.

In any case, nobody should be pressured on these minor aesthetic things","[It is](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarf#Description). Also, you're assuming the pictures you see of the heavily armoured dwarf with a beard swinging a battleaxe is a man because they have a beard.",dndmemes
"Idk why this needs to be said, but if you’re a DM who isn’t allowing their players to play the character the way they want, you are the biggest asshole in the room. Actively denying your players the right to play their character their way is limiting their ability to RP the character they want, even if it’s a bearded dwarf woman. 

It’s like me saying my players can’t make a Chaotic Evil character because I don’t like them personally. No, I just *work with it* like a grown ass adult. It’s okay to not like something. It’s another to tell someone they can’t just because you don’t like something.","Why? If you're homebrewing a setting where certain things just flat out don't exist, and you're the DM, you're allowed to exert some sort of creative control. As a player, you always have the ability to walk away from a game if it doesn't cater to your desires.

"The situation: a red dragon killed a silver one. Red has hired you to clear out silver's hoard before his lair in the sky falls to the ground. You also want to rescue silver's servants who have been left behind. Everyone who gets rescued has to pay a fee. You, as adventurers, are specifically tasked with saving as much treasure as possible. 

The raiding is almost complete. For now everyone has stashed most of the treasure in the main entrance room. Mostly gold and luxury items, etc. Some of it seems like it might be magical. There are also manuscripts, scrolls, books and other things. 

Most notably though is A pair of 'cloud runner' rings that one of your rescues identified. They will allow you to run on clouds, even unenchanted ones.

Aside from the party, you are traveling with:

1. The silver dragon's former steward. An old elf wizard. She's not fast, but is fairly spry for her age. Her slots, however, are all used up.

2. A wounded knight. He was hurt badly in a fight, and can only limp now. Very slow.

3. A trio of servants. Healthy, but not particularly dexterous.

The party itself: 

1. A tabaxi rogue,
2. A lizardman barbarian who will tell Red anything you don't.
3. A human fighter
4. A Dragonborn paladin. All his magic is for healing or smiting.

The disaster:

Behind you Silver's fortress begins to sink into the clouds and, before you, sixty feet away on a floating platform, stands Red, the dragon. He awaits your approach. But as you step out onto the clouds, the first of you nearly stumble all the way through. 

The silver dragon's magic is almost completely faded. Mere minutes remain for the fortress to remain airborne. This is earlier than expected. There is no way you'll get all of the treasure back to Red.

The wizard tells you you have thirty two rounds left. (Three minutes, six seconds) The various NPCs panic. One says, aloud, ""I wish we had enough time to make a plan.""

The world grows still, color fades from everything except the players and NPCs. Even red, from his imperious perch, has stopped moving. The assistant looks down at some of the treasure clutched in his hands and noticed a ring with a single red stone. A stone that shatters as you look at it. (A wish ring)

**In summary**

1. You need to get everyone to the red dragon.
2. Using the rings, two can go at a time. And on can carry back both rings.
2. They all need to be carrying treasure when they get to him.
3. Players need to be carrying as much treasure as they can be, every time you reach him. (So no carrying NPCs.)
5. The distance is two regular rounds away for an average PC.
6. You can plan as long as you want, but once you do anything but plan,
4. You have thirty two rounds. Anyone not loaded will die.
7. You may not use the 'planning time' to identify scrolls or other objects. But can after you've started running.
8. Not everyone moves at the same speed.

Soldier is hurt, it will take him ten rounds to get to Red.

Wizard is old and slow, it will take her five rounds.

Everyone else will take two at normal walking speed.

(Wow there are a lot, a lot, a lot of elements to this. It didn't seem nearly as complicated in my head.)

What do you all do about this?","Barbarian throws the NPCs/caster casts levitate/featherfall, PCs carry the loot to Red. If there's still time to rescue the people, assuming it's featherfall, then good PCs can go back to rescue the NPCs. If it's levitate, then you don't have to rescue anyone because they're all able to fly. Or tenser's floating disk can carry the NPCs/loot. No need to overthink a puzzle when you can do magic.",dndmemes
"To be fair, most of the times I've seen this happen in a game it was almost entirely the DMs fault.

Sure, the party deliberates too long, of course they do. Failing to figure out a riddle in real life rarely has consequences, hence there is far less inhibition to just answer.

But if just a tiny bit of a riddle gets misspoken or left out, it often goes from literal child's play to straight up unsolveable. Same with poor context clues, or missing cultural contextualization.

And several times the answer the DM had for the riddle was just straight up, factually, 100% wrong.","And there is nothing more frustrating than having your DM chuckle because the party can't solve the puzzle ... and realizing they just told it wrong ><

Not all pcos women will grow facial hair but those that do often spend a whole lot of time and money on hiding it.

This is how Cheery should have looked in that BBC abomination.,"While I agree that I'm disappointed that Dwarves aren't as visually distinct in the show (I think the show in general was kneecapped by its budget), I'm not sure I agree that ""attractive woman +beard"" would be the right direction. Depicting her as trans is probably the closest allegory we have to the kind of shock and disgust Cheery faced amongst other dwarves.

Hell, per the wiki: ""When she goes back to Überwald as an open female she causes the same kind of reaction that gays created when first 'coming out' and clearly Pratchett is drawing parallels.   However it isn't long before, she begins a cultural revolution and introduces two new pronouns - ""she"" and ""her"" - to the dwarfish language. Many detest her, calling her ""Ha'ak"", which is an extremely derogatory word in Dwarfish""

He seemed confused, so I said “I was told it means a lot to you”. He told me I was terrible but couldn’t keep a grin off his face. That’s one of my favorite memories from high school.

"Took a bunch of improv classes back in the day, one of the main rules we learned was that you can always play someone who is worse than you at something, but never someone who's better.  If you try, you have to make it a joke that this person is clearly not as smart/charismatic/strong/etc. as they think they are, though everyone in universe will act like they are.  So like if a scene calls for a math whiz and you are not one, you have to super confidently say either something really simple or some blatently incorrect math facts, and so long as everyone else reacts like it's genius, the character will work.

It's hilarious and great when done right in improv, but unfortunately you need a DM and group who are willing to go along with it in D&D, so I generally end up playing characters with high charisma scores on paper but who couldn't convince a ziplock bag to open.  It's honestly the reason that I am in favor of letting people make persuasion rolls even if they weren't that persuasive.  A dumb argument working with a good roll can be funny in much the same way those improv scenarios are!","""If we weren't intended to roll for things then why do we have skills for them?"" -some guy I play D&D with

Now at 15 int he actually started to RP accurately so we are debating releasing his point from time out.,"We’ve got a similar play. Int 17 sorcerer that has the worst ideas in the group and we’ve had to talk him out of having his character do things that would be suicidal.

"Idea for a campaign with a spell caster BBEG:

An all-sorcerer party with subtle spell and counterspell. Each time the BBEG tries to cast a spell, it’s negated, but subtly. The BBEG then has to figure out which caster is counterspelling him/her. 

The party gives no hints. They just stand in a circle or semicircle around the BBEG, t-posing while they counterspell, without speaking, without moving. Occasionally they cast other spells, not bothering to be subtle about those. But whenever the BBEG tries to retaliate, it gets counterspelled. Subtly.

The party wins not by killing the BBEG, but by stalling him or her out of spell slots. The BBEG runs out first because there’s more collective slots among the party, and they’re sorcerers, so they can replenish their spell slots with font of magic. The encounter ends with the t-posing sorcerers just closing in on the helpless BBEG.",YES,dndmemes

I’d rather save the money and risk encountering a dumpster fire campaign.","The DM could instead take up a second job and earn hundreds/thousands of dollars instead of spending dozens and dozens of hours preparing a game for total strangers on the net.

It makes sense. If you’re a good DM who puts in a lot of work and you’re willing to provide that service to a bunch of randos, asking for a small fee so that they feel invested and actually show up is not unreasonable at all. 

If you’re just playing with your friends you don’t need to charge anything because you’re friends and you presumably can rely on each other to be reliable. 

But with randos on the internet, you’ll get all sorts who are flakey, not paying close attention, or asks you to do a bunch of extra work for them and then leaves your game and never appreciate it. Sometimes you’ll get a great table. Sometimes you won’t. Charging a small fee ups your chances of getting a good table that will show up reliably, participate, and respect the game.",dndmemes
"I don't feel bad charging to be a DM because I put a lot of work into my games. Roll20, writing API/Script so every attack/spell has a different sound or visual depending on how the die rolls.

"We appreciate feedback, even negative feedback. The truly heartbreaking thing is when players just don't care. I'm sure most DMs would prefer players with negative opinions over players who put the game extremely low on their priority list.

"The world needs more DMs. 

After running games for the last 6 years, I can confidently say how difficult it can be. I cringe thinking about the mistakes I made early on but think I have learned from them.

Many think the challenges of DMing is the planning or world building, or having great NPCs with memorable voices.

But it’s really about paying attention to the table and its needs. Properly setting expectations and effectively communicating with the group or with players individually.

And DMs have to learn when something is not working. And be willing to end the game if the table is just not compatible.

I think we see so many RPG horror stories because people will cling to a toxic game just because finding a group and a DM is so hard in the first place.

Bad DMs thinking they are great, because the players keep showing up. But in reality they are the only option and people are starved for games.

It’s created a weird ecosystem where people are having to pay for DM services.

I don’t think Wizards has really acknowledged that players expect so much more from the game then they did in the past. With things like Critical Role, most DMs and players are wanting more than a dungeon crawl or war game with a skeleton plot. They are wanting and expecting deep and meaningful characters and drama. And that don’t come easy.

I don’t know the fix and this has kinda been a rant. I guess props to all those DMs out there and the players that engage and help out!","I honestly got so lucky with my group! All close friends, 3 complete amateurs and a veteran who's been playing since... 3.5? early 4e? not sure but longer than I've been DMing is for sure. I recently (totally accidentally) killed off the veteran's character and it was honestly pretty emotional. The group has had a weird obsession with corn and Valhalla and I assured them that there is plenty of corn in Asgard. Currently going to (spoilers y'all. Jack, Nathan, Alex, Dylan, you know who you are.) see a witch doctor who's been having some wendigo trouble to see if they can get him revived.",dndmemes

"As a dm, if I’m being boring or whatever, tell me. If you don’t like a character, kill them. If you don’t like a plot, ignore it.

It means they might return as NPCs or even get picked up by the player again some time in the future.",dndmemes
"You see, me and my friends have an odd spin on this. We try to be as big of a dick as possible to the other players by begging the DM to do weird stuff to everyone else's characters.

I agree it must come from both sides of the table, but unless the DM has at least some idea of what is going to happen (or at least some mode to determine stuff happening off-scene) it's going to feel like absurdist improv theatre.

What is crit dead?,"When you die so much that you can't roll death saves. It can happen a number of ways, but usually it's when you take double your total hp (max) or your total hp plus your remaining hp in damage.

Rogue has 25 HP at max and is full health, 50 HP damage means you're crit dead and not rolling death saves

or

Rogue has max 25 HP and has 10 HP currently, 35 damage means you're crit dead

&#x200B;

Additionally, I believe there's another rule that states if you're hit during a death save it counts as autofail. So if you're playing with that rule and your downed man is hit by fireball or another AOE attack, that's going to be a failed save. Or if you're 1v1 and the dude keeps clobbering you when you're down, then you could quite possibly die for good.",dndmemes

Also, it can be fun to turn that particular hit into a ""memorable"" hit.

"I hate that people don’t use dragons effectively. Like the whole point of a dragon is to be the scariest thing on the planet. That’s why you never let the dragon stay in a fight when it’s outside it’s lair. 


When it’s in it’s lair then you pull out all the stops. You make the environment as deadly as the dragon, lava pits that explode when he roars, ice spikes that fall from the ceiling when he slams his tail, a constant gas that will do damage to everyone expect the dragon, that sort of thing. If the players think it’s unfair you have to explain that dragons are smart, they will live in turf that only they can handle and will always fight when it has the upper hand. 


The key is to NEVER fuck with a color palette dragon. Also don’t seduce one either it would be like if the monkeys at the zoo started making bedroom eyes at you",There is a good deal many creatures stronger than a dragon.,dndmemes

"Ive said it once, I've said it a thousand times. 

Tangled is a DnD one shot. 

Rapunzel is a divine soul sorcerer, noble background (but she doesn't know it), cure wounds is her main spell. She's very low level, which is why you don't see her doing any crazy magic. High Charisma, great animal handling skill, knocked Flynn out with a frying pan out of instinct, kept it cause she got a lucky crit and decided she couldn't leave it behind. 

Mother gothel is a mastermind rogue, crazy high deception and stealth skills. DM flavor let's her use a spell slot from Rapunzel to stay young for a few days. 

Eugene ""Flynn Ryder"" Fitzherbert is a swashbuckler rogue. Super high deception skill, but always rolls like shit on them, causing no one to ever believe him and many laughs from the players. Doesn't normally carry a weapon, so when cornered by three guards he decided to ask ""is the frying pan a finesse weapon?"" The DM allowed it because now it's a funny joke, expecting more bad rolls, but then Flynn rolls amazing and solos the encounter. The frying pan is forever a meme. 

The ruffians were supposed to be showing consequences for flynns criminal ways, having them recognize him and send for the guards to collect the bounty. However, Rapunzel crits a persuasion check to stop them, and while the DM contemplates how to handle it, he notices something. All these NPCs he made have some type of proficency (instruments, cooks utensils, etc) and decides on the fly that they are all just doing mercenary work to support their true passions.

"It's a really tough question,  since for each, you get two melee and one ranged option.
The defender celestial has the highest CR (19), while the devil has the highest movement (fly 60).

If the space wasn't limited, the devil would probably win in most cases, in-depth analysis: 
With his 60 ft movement, he can comfortably stay out of melee range and also always close enough for his own range (since the fly 40 of the celestials < fly 60), its CR is 18, the avenger's only 17. The devil's attack also deals 1 more damage on average (while the radiant damage type of the celestial is preferable over the fiend's fire, it doesn't make a difference here) than the avenger (again, the avengers other edge over the devil, being the possibility to hit from 500 ft away, doesn't matter since the devil decides how far away exactly he is).
The only remaining thing is the avenger has 10 more hp than the devil. I guess this won't help because of the lower CR and the devil's movement (it's a bit early over here and I can't really think this through, but I guess the devil might use his additional movement to stay within range for his own attack while also always imposing disadvantage on the avenger's attack?).","These are good points. It may be that the Celestial would want to try and attack from a disadvantaged distance just to keep the devil out of range, but the devil does have the greater movement at the end of the day. It may end up being a game of footsies as the devil has to guess if the Celestial will move away on its next turn to avoid an attack or towards it to attack normally.",dndmemes

As that party reaches level 3 (or whatever, but best to keep it at a relatively low level), they mind a maguffin which ""reboots"" to the moment the party came together, except keeping in their level 3 stats. Would work particularly well if the beginning of the campaign was unraveling a mystery or solving a murder, they would be armed with the knowledge of what's going to happen IN ADVANCE to jump to the end of the mystery, plus they would be strong enough to prevent the **insert bad campaign event here* BEFORE it happens in the first place. They would feel really powerful, like it was a cheat code. The game proceeds for a while before they notice something about the timeline is different. If they search for the maguffin again, ITS GONE, someone else is using it to reboot time and is working against them. They become the main antagonist and the game becomes a cat and mouse game of each side rebooting the timeline (but retaining knowledge and level ups) to try and gain the upper hand on the other side by expanding their knowledge and influencing world events.

The problem with the quotes is fatigue. they are all well recognized meme quotes that have been around a long time. Because of this the fatigue is already there.

"4 seems interesting, is it worth the hate it gets?","It is not.  Most of the people who hate on it have never played it, and likely never will.

Out of combat was streamlined, but included a lot of things most people now consider ""homebrew additions"" like skill challenges.  The skill system was pretty much identical to what 5e uses.

Combat systems were relatively balanced, and mechanically structured to be more ""gamist"" (this works as a game, change your descriptions as you wish) than ""simulationist"" (the rules are meant to mimic the laws of physics, for better or worse, no you may not use your imagination to redescribe things.)

It wasn't perfect, and early publications had low monster damage and high HP (which was fixed very well mid-run) which made early-run combats kinda slow and almost as boring at low level as they are in every version of D&D-- the fixes made running combats and building them incredibly easy from a DM perspective. (Like... imagine a CR system that actually works.  Like... *every single time*.) Which made it way easier to spend 15 minutes throwing together a quick encounter and the rest of your prep time finding art and music and writing story and plot hooks.

The biggest complaint I saw is that it didn't have a terribly designed ""little brother class"" like the Champion Fighter to make your ""little brother"" play because you assumed he wasn't smart enough to do anything other than roll one die and do some simple addition.  The fact that things other than spell casters could be interesting and heroic made some people *very* angry.  Still does.",dndmemes

But that's exactly what that is about: you shouldn't metagame, and act as if you had the right spells prepared when you haven't. If your char didn't know better, then he didn't.

"Legit question though: Why not let all spell casters have every spell prepared? What does it break? They still have their limited spell slots. Wizards have spellbooks they can read from... it doesn't make sense that they NEED to prepare spells.

"I mean, Artificers are magical, and the stuff they make is also magical.

Traditional Magic users are more of the old guard trying hold on to it (and the political power that comes with it) who purposely try to keep the world in a stagnate state (therefore hold on to their power). Artificers are able to redistribute said power with their inventions and innovation and thus bring the world forward out of the Midevil Dark Ages.

"I made a fighter, with the goal of having them worship one of the Norse deities. This was for a friend's homebrew game. I didn't want to be basic, so rather than Thor I went for Loki. I made my fighter someone that contrasts Loki in a number of ways, and played it as a gradual change as the character took rogue levels, trying to show character development. My fighter is chaotic good. I never actually cared that the book calls Loki chaotic evil, as I was thinking of Loki more of a trickster than a truly 'evil' or maniacal entity. When I made the character, Loki was on my proposal that was okayed by the DM. 

Things were fine for a long time, I didn't bring Loki up because it wasn't relevant to our missions or anything. To me, the gradual change and internal conflict were at the core of what made the character interesting. One day we were just chatting about different gods and I mentioned my character's worship of Loki. The DM's best friend said:  


""Your character isn't evil. Your character wouldn't worship Loki.""  


Things just went downhill from there. When I first started playing with this group years before, I was very new and inexperienced. At this point, I had grown leaps and bounds as a player, though mainly in other groups as I had ran other games of my own and absorbed much more content. Unfortunately, first impressions are powerful, so this group still doesn't respect my opinion. Instantly the DM sides completely with the other player, saying I have to change it. I say I don't want to, as it's party of who my character is. Then the player drops another gem:   


""That's not who your character was at the start of the campaign.""  


At this point I got a bit flustered. For personal reasons, I've always had a bit of trouble really opening up with this group, so my RP has always been brief and as quick as possible.  Now this was being weaponized against me, as I was being expected to stay the same for the whole campaign. To me, this was frustrating, as character development is part of the game. The conversation later continued online, with the DM telling me that when a player really wants to stick with a certain deity it's 'metagame-y'. At that point I sadly just change my worship to Thor (same alignment) and accept playing a boring character.   
Months later, I try again, instead looking for one of the deities in the pantheon of gods for my character's races. When I look for other options to retcon my character's faith to, the DM tells me that having a character built around following a god is lazy character building, that fighters aren't known for worship, and that gods are really just there to give paladins and priests powers.  


We continued for a few more sessions and then COVID got started. Fortunately the DM isn't very interested in running online games, so I've had lots of time separate from that group. It really is nice to play where I'm respected by others, and overruled on who my own character is. 

I should probably include in here that there was literally never a time where I was trying to get a mechanical benefit or gain off of worship. This wasn't some weird ask to try and get extra features or bonuses. Just the understanding of who my character was as a person.","I mean, in the world where not having a patron deity leads to ceaseless suffering in some wall, starting with a deity that appeals is OK?

Also of all the Norse deities, Víðarr/Vidar who is a god of silence, vengeance and (suddenly) forests seems like an interesting option.",dndmemes
">Christians aren't complaining


>DND Group

It must be nice to be so young you missed the ""satanic panic"" surrounding DnD when christians attempted to cancel it.","It is nice. But my parents are older. So when I started playing, THEY knew about it. My dad didn't care, just didn't get it. My mom thought I was in a suicide cult and my life irl was tied to a character sheet, even after I told her my first character already died in 20 minutes, fighting a 3 foot lizard. So I used Pathfinder sheets instead of 3.5. She backed off when I said ""It's like a Lord of the Rings game or Skyrim, just with dice and more imagination instead of a Playstation.""",dndmemes
"This is actually something I seriously struggle with in these games. Maybe because I've not had a long game to get into the feel of it but picking a deity from a chart the size of a phonebook and trying to make a connection to them somehow just... doesn't *happen* for me. I want it to happen, but I can't make it work.

"I want to have my Druid worship a god of nature, but they’re also a Circle of Wildfire Druid.

Sure goblins may be weak, and most people have a rough internalization of a goblins stats, but if you throw a group of goblins AND a bigger enemy then it becomes a strategic choice on wether to kill the weaker creatures or the single big one first. You can even mix up creatures with weaknesses and resistances to the same elements, like using Hags with Trolls or animated plants, that prevent the players from using the same tactics against all monsters in the encounter if they want to minimize the damage they take and maximize their damage output.",dndmemes

Sure, probably you'd get one player who makes a more ""comic-relief"" character, but if they understand how the world you created works i'm sure most people would be willing to keep the comedy aspects subtle or at least avoid the ""lol so random"" type of humor for this campaign.

Communication is key, and i wouldn't be opposed to a serious campaign where i play as a more serious person (tho a moment of levity here and there wouldn't hurt, i'd try to go for a chuckle in-character rather than a sitcom feel... also depends on how long the campaign  is, if its a one-shot i doubt i'd even try to crack a joke, but if it's a campaign that lasts months or years sometimes i would do, always in-character, of course), so i'm sure you could find other players who think alike.",dndmemes

2. One time he crossed someone few would dare to challenge. Old Greg had it out for Yorlof and Yorlof found his arch enemy. This all started because Yorlof refused the baileys in a shoe and snowballed into a duel in a cave fighting for the release of Old Greg's caged prisoners.  


1. The best story was the time he attempted to smuggle his sword into a club past some guards. For context, his sword can retract into the hilt kinda like the sword in dishonored.

'I thought there werent any threats?'

'Well his chance of TPK is Nil, so he isnt really a 'threat' persay'

...


Ive been subjected to quite a few of these, its annoying AF to have the DM parse every word from you and convert it into exactly the opposite of what you were shooting for. Even if the player isnt phrasing it exactly perfect, you know damned well what they are trying to do.

Another one, was that we were all finishing up a boss room where the BBEG had disappeared before we killed him. 'I want to look for a secret door' I said. Combat ends, and the group is waiting for me to find the 'secret door'.

10 IRL minutes pass of us trying to figure it out, and thrn someone else goes 'there really isnt a door?' To which the DM goes 'There is a door, it just isnt hidden, and you've given the BBEG plenty of time to escape.'",dndmemes

If there was literally no lock I assume any proficient rogue or lockpicker could shim the  latch mechanism open
 
If there is no mechanisms likely the door would have swung open or been moved in the attempt to shim or pick the door.

It's always good to remember that when a player says 'I roll to pick the lock' they often don't feel like they have the time to explain every action in detail for the sake of the rest of the party and the game as a sign whole. Not to mention most players are not always fully aware of the processes needed to take place in order for that roll to realistically happen.","Oh, of course! It’s just my players didn’t try anything. They just started discussing about what they SHOULD do, but never attempted. They were so dumbfounded that there was no lock to pick, so they just started asking how on earth they were going to get in. Eventually, someone tried to pry open the door with a crowbar, and they found the door was unlocked.",dndmemes
"Many interactions are lost in the theater of the mind, such as a door having a knob, handle and/or lock. It's up to the DM to clearly explain what the characters clearly see in front of them. 

* If there is a doorknob or handle, tell them.
* If there is no doorknob or handle, tell them.

The goblins were making the world a worse place with their actions, thus it is good to get rid of them. There's no reason why a pc can't apply the same logic to 'heretics.'",Goblins actively attacking a village are not the same thing as heretics.

"I might disagree with this, it depends on the relevant definition of ""heretics"". If a ""heretic"" is someone who have slightly different religious views and aren't hurting anybody, I agree with you whole-heartedly.

"I play a ... neutral good paladin, and a friend is playing a true neutral undead warlock in the same game.  

We coordinated and did this on purpose :)

The warlock had his contact foist upon him by a technically-dead god, and has to eat the hearts of sapient beings to retain his intelligence.  He'd like to... Not be doing that.  
The paladin has a relationship with his god less like a devoted servant and more like the relationship between 'reformed' criminal and parole officer.  Since this heart-eating warlock is the only lead the party has on the plot, the paladin has decided it's his job to ethically source hearts for him.  By robbing a morgue.

Great RP session with the DM last game where the paladin got to tell his God that if she didn't want him stealing organs, she could either give him better leads or hire someone other than the guy on death row for quintuple homicide for her chosen.

Blocking your path toward us a large door with an inscription stating drink the fate of X in order to open the door. Before the door you are 3 chalices filled with a mysterious liquid on top of 3 pedestals. 

An inscription lies beneath each pedestal as well. The first pedestal is inscribed ‘the star of X’, the second ‘the fortune of X’, and the last is ‘the luck of X’.

In this puzzle there is an obvious solution. Don’t know which one to drink? Well power on and have the Barbarian chug all 3. Sure he’ll take poison damage but it will open the doors.

Now what is the ‘proper’ solution to the puzzle? That’s up to you, you can drop hints, have them roll history checks, etc. the best solution I’ve found was for a particular historical NPC X was fling all 3 chalices to the ground because the NPC was famous for his hatred of astrology, executed fortune tellers, and claimed he needed no luck.

No.  They want to save him and drag him back to the village to face justice.

"I've never been a fan of puzzles in the game.  My low int barbarian wouldn't figure it out in character, why should I the player do it?  It detracts from the immersion.

Conversely a player who may not be great at puzzles is role playing a wizard with a 190 IQ.  Why can't he just roleplay that his character figures it out?  It's not like the dm has the fighter's player do some barbell curls in real life before making a strength check.

The other issue I take is exactly this meme.  That players are dumb when it comes to puzzles.  It's quite antagonistic and goes against how a good dm should act.   It's quite possible that the solution seems simple when you already know the answer. Or it's possible the players may think that the simple solution is not the actual solution and are concerned that it will put them in more danger by choosing it.","I find puzzles are a fun way to kinda vary things up a bit, but are probably best used sparsely for that very reason. They're too reliant on out of character knowledge. Although, i still like them very much, and i feel like there are plenty of ways to mitigate these problems.

One classic solution is awarding hints to players with higher Int, some people like to make them roll for it, but i don't really see the point, after all, you **want** them to get the hint, otherwise it's back to square one. If you're going to roll, i think a good way is doing it like the ""Idea roll"" from Call of Cthulhu 7e, where even if you fail the roll, you still get a hint, but it will come at a cost, like exposing you to danger in some way or another.

As for the ""low int barb"" example, you can try to rp or have the dm describe you stumbling into the answer somehow, you can tell the players out of character, or you can treat the whole ""solving the puzzle"" section of the game as an out of character way of representing how the party as a group, eventually found the answer, regardless of which individual player thought of it.",dndmemes

If my character needs to dodge out of the way of trap, the DM doesn’t check my rolling and jumping ability, we check the characters.  But come across something simple like “what is water?” and we get 14+ wisdom characters fumbling around for 3 hours because I guess they aren’t really as smart as the numbers on the character sheet would imply.

"IMO most DMs are just bad at making puzzles. When you design a puzzle, the players are playing against YOU, the person they know. So if they think you want to trick them, they will try to figure that out.

My group instantly told me to shut up for meta gaming because I was a dumb barbarian and I couldn't solve riddles. So I stubbornly sat there quietly for ALMOST TWO FUCKING HOURS while the other 4 guys failed to solve the easiest riddle imaginable, which is famous from a book they've all read, and which had literally been said out loud right at the start.

I personally love Tom bombadil even if he doesn't serve any purpose in the story. Just such a fun character in my opinion. But yeah I guess the ents mentioning him would be the DMS homage to the player.,My absolute favorite part of Tom is the fact that they consider him as potentially being the only person powerful enough to keep the ring safe- but also admit that this would be a bad idea because Tom would probably get bored of it or simply misplace it after a short period of time.,dndmemes

"Saw something similar to that in a twitch game I follow. The party just finished mediating negotiations between a Pixie who runs a lumbermill  with a bunch of other sprites, fairies and pixies and a human businessman.

The negotiations were successful, the human had left, the fey were celebrating, and the party had finished negotiating their pay from both parties.

Just as the session is about to end, the rogue takes out an incense stick, saying she wants to throw it at the Pixie, just to see if/prove she can. The DM has her roll at disadvantage because small target, crowded room, *improvised weapon*, etc

She hits, and goes to roll damage when he stops her and describes the incense stick as impaling the pixie through the chest before he bursts into pixie dust.

""Because you have decent stats, an Improvised weapon is 1d4, and...Pixies have a single hit point.""

""But...I was just messing around, it's just an incense stick""

"When I DM, I make it clear that Multiclassing is allowed, but talk to me about it so we can work together to bring it into the story somehow. I don't say you need to have years and years of training to be a wizard, that's just dumb. 

But if you start the game as a farm boy who never saw a spell cast before they joined the party, yeah you better RP it a bit. Even if its just saying ""In between adventures I talk to (X wizard) about magic a bit."" 

But no, you can't just spring on me ""I'm taking a level in X class"" on level up. That's not gonna fly.","Yeah, we do this as well. Our Arcane Trickster did a wizard multiclass. He was an urching taken in by a university professor wizard and spend the whole campaign gobbling up every book he could find, while also traveling alongside an actual wizard in the party. Rarely seen a multiclass as justified as this when he did it on lv 12.

Similarly, on the campaign where I am player myself I multiclassed my rogue in ranger and warlock. Ranger was easy since I was traveling alongside one and we spend the first 5 lvl in the wilderness. Warlock was a bit trickier, but I got a blessing from the ravenqueen after having a near death experience and being saved.

But if the DM controls *all* the other characters we’ll ever meet, then let me control just this one, even if I don’t add enough of the arbitrary flavor despite meeting the multiclassing requirements sometimes. 

Is it better with fun narrative flavor? Yes! 

Is it somehow incongruent that multiclassing into Wizard isn’t allowed because “you never learned magic” but Eldritch Knight and Arcane Trickster leveling up is totally fine? Also yes!

"Pathfinder has an optional system called automatic bonus progression which eliminates all the magic items and enchantments that give flat mathematical bonuses like +1 weapons or belts of strength. Instead, your wealth by level is cut in half but you get scaling bonuses for free (Pathfinder assumes you have a certain amount of magical stat boosting as you level up, so this keeps you in line with challenge rating expectations) and instead you can only get magic items that actually do something interesting. 

I love this rule because I'd much rather find a flaming sword than a +1 sword. And you get more chances for fun items like the gloves of reconnaissance, which let you peak through walls with a touch. Or insistent doorknockers, which let you create a temporary door in a wall. Or a bag of tricks, which lets you throw random animals at people, possibly through a door your friend just made.

Logic doesn't follow through. Lizard folk are all lizard but mermaids are half human,Their reproductive organs are in the fish half.,dndmemes
"Well Mermaids are also Sirens. They are mythological creatures that seduce seamen. Seduction and temptation is part of the legend.
As well not every depiction of a Siren or Mermaid does have breasts. They were seductresses but they just wanted you to crash your ship into the rocks. Most commonly the men would think they see a beautiful woman and sometimes would then see the true ugly creature right before they died. The images of them with effeminate attractive features are the false images of them. A painting or something of them isnt them saying this is what we think they look. Its like saying ""this is what we think will make seamen go nuts and crash their ships.""

Also mermaids are top-half-people, bottom-half-fish, not anthropomorphized fish. You ever played League of Legends? Cassiopea has tits because shes is a bottom-half-snake, top-half-woman. 

PS I get that it's all just a joke to some people. I don't really take it too seriously I just type a lot when Im on the shitter. However every joke has a kernel of truth. Sometimes its just way to easy, at least for me, to see why what I know are supposed to just be humorous facetious comments made, are just plain dumb and wrong 🤷‍♂️ Like I just kinda chuckle to myself that this guy used Mermaids/Sirens to even try to make a joke. I more just end up laughing at how silly the attempted joke is.","I mean you're not wrong. But think about it. Your example was League of Legends. Nami, a legitimate water-dwelling creature and also designed in reference to the pop-culture depiction of a mermaid has tits. What for? Attraction of males of course, in and out of lore. Now the question is, would we be able to transfer this truth over to D&D? Because D&D has much less visual appeal in its designs since 90% of things happen in our fantasy. Moreover, there are canon forms of lizardfolk, yuan-ti etc. Which don't appear to have breasts (pureblood excluded). But we gotta think about creative freedom and personal fantasy. Which is the whole point but I like funny discussions and trains of thought. In essence, if people wanna have reptile breasts, they can come up with some neat explanation for it. If they don't want those, they just won't because they have their lore reasons. So let everybody play their own way of D&D.",dndmemes
"Ok you asked for it: 

Despite their name and outward appearance lizardfolk may not necessarily be reptilian in nature and may in fact be mammalian. Case and point a vulnerability to cold damage is conspicuously absent from the lizardfolk stat block which you would expect from a reptilian as they are universally cold blooded. This would imply that lizardfolk are in fact warm blooded and have far more in common with mammals than reptiles, furthermore while rare it is not unknown for mammals to have scales (for example pangolin) and the lizardfolk's other prominent features namely a powerful bite and their ability to hold their breath for a considerable amount of time have also been seen in other species of mammals. Most tellingly however the lizardfolk ability to make and use tools and form societal bonds is rather atypical of reptiles who generally speaking are known for being ungregarious in nature. In conclusion the depiction of a lizardfolk to have mammary glands is not as implausible as initially thought.

In regard to mermaids the swimming pattern of their tails (vertical oscillations rather than horizontal) mirrors that of whales and dolphins both of which are known to be mammalian, in addition to this dolphins are well known to feed their newly born calf milk early in it's life and will wean it before having another. These two facts together imply that it's perfectly plausible for a mermaid to be in possession of fully functional mammary glands, furthermore as aquatic mammals have an evolutionary advantage to be in possession of higher fat reserves than their land based counterparts in order to insulate themselves from being immersed in the water they inhabit it is not only plausible but probable that the average mermaid will have far more prominent mammary glands than the average human female","troglodytes nor lizards (giant or any other variety) has a vulnerability to cold either so that point is moot.

"Sorry, the barbarian has more HP, and/ot will survive longer even if you consider the ward a part of the wizards HP.

So, 12 + (unknown) con + average (7) + (unknown). Let's say +3 to be fair.

12+3+7+3=25

Wizard is a d6 hit die, average 4, and +3 con + tough feat + ward.

6+3+4+3+ (tough feat which is 2×level, so 4) 4 +ward =20 +ward

You do get your ward once per long rest, but that's not actually your hit points. It just soaks up damage and can only be used once per long rest AND requires you to have cast an abjuration spell. You also can't heal the ward.

At the least it will give you 4 temp hit points at 2nd level + intelligence mod (which is at least +1 if you're normal). So anywhere from 5 to 9 ward hit points at 2nd level.

Don't think your wizard is going to survive as long though. Can't heal the ward, meaning you can't take any damage to continue to compete with the barbarians HP (or can only have the ward take a number of Hit points equal to your INT mod minus 1). No healing from a party member and no short rest hit dice.

Also the barbarian can wear medium/light armor or even no armor and they'll still have an AC of CON + DEX and anything they choose still let's them wear a shield.

If the wizard and barbarian have equal DEX of 10, then the barbarian can have an AC of 15 with no armor, and at basically no cost. The wizard will need to cast mage armor and will only have an AC of 13. If the barbarian has a +1 shield and/or a +1 armor (or higher) this discrepancy increases further.

Additionally, the barbarian has rage which will more than halve the damage from the three weapon damage types. This is a limited resource, but can be used twice as much as the ward for an abjuration wizard at 2nd level, and in some cases more than doubles your hit points because of the way resistances work. This ability still works even if the barbarian has taken damage (unlike the ward that only protects you for those hit points that can't be healed).","dude just wrote a wiki paye to reply to a meme.

"I'm fine with bearded and unbearded dwarven ladies.

Dwarven beards function pretty much like human beards. You get them around puberty and they just are ordinary hair. Another thing dwarves have in common with humans is that they are unbearded as children. I see three ways to resolve this:

- Sexual dimorphism manifests in different way among dwarves, but humans associate beards with masculinity and thus are annoying female dwarves by misgendering them out of ignorance.
- In ancient times, dwarven societies were more patriarchal than today. You still can only have power if you have a long beard, female dwarves wear false beards because of that. The idea of just ending this tradition is offensive to most dwarves. 
- 90% of dwarves are male. Most people never see a female dwarve because most of the remaining 10% have important roles in dwarven cities which don't allow for travelling the world. Thus, humans assume that dwarven women have beards - a rumor many travelling dwarves perpetuate as an elaborate prank.

"Speaking as a biologist,  female dwarves having beards is waaaaay easier to accept than reptiles evolving mammary glands.  The latter would be a pretty startling case of convergent evolution.   Facial hair on female dwarves, though?  That's just a species difference in degree in well, hirsutism.   It's pretty easy for me to logically accept,  even assuming dwarves and humans had a common ancestor- amount/length of hair varies pretty wildly among mammals.   (Or even within a species with enough selection: think husky vs a greyhound).  

Most every setting I've seen, it seems to be pretty much accepted that -while both male dwarves and male humans have beards- the dwarves beards are more impressive.   In my head, at least,  dwarves just are overall more hirsute than humans, which translates to at least some facial hair on (at least some) females,  and very thick/full facial hair on males.  

When I ran a female dwarf, she did not have a beard, but *did* have luxuriant sideburns.   😁","Other biologist here to confirm. Although beards are a secondary sexual characteristic is humans, beards aren’t unique to humans, and in other species they aren’t always inherently masculine e.g. orangutans. And as you said, just a difference of where hair grows, which can vary significantly within a species. Constantly enlarged breasts are a uniquely human trait.",dndmemes
"I really don't get the idea that female dwarves should have beards too. Why? Because all male dwarves have beards? (Almost) All human males have beards too, most of us just shave them.","I think female dwarves should have beards because having a beard in an incredibly dusty environment, like the mines and forges dwarves almost always live around in fiction, would be extremely favorable in natural selection",dndmemes
The beards only slightly differ and that is the only way to gender a dwarf,Male beards are more dense while female beards are more voluminous. These differences are obvious to other dwarves but almost completely unnoticeable to the other races,dndmemes
The real controversy is if dwarves hatch from eggs/geodes or are birthed like other mammals. Personally I prefer the eggs since my players never know if the npc is joking or being serious.,"The eggs are covered in hard stone and when they hatch, a giant explosion happens.",dndmemes
"No reason to stop with the beards.  In my primary campaign world, there is a fairly even distribution of sexually male and sexually female dwarves. However, dwarves have a much smaller cranium-to-hip ratio than humans, and take longer to reach maturity. These factors along with adaption to lightless or low-light environments mean that sexual dimorphism, particularly in visible traits, is much lower among dwarves, and primarily takes the form of pheromone compounds they express through glands in their throats. Pregnancy takes a much smaller toll on them, and gland-expressed pheromones are responsible for family group bonding. Male and female dwarves will lactate in response to their child's pheromones, and the caretaker role is split between them more-or-less evenly. They all grow beards, they all work and fight when needed, and they value the same traits of dedication, strength, and bravery, regardless of an individual's sex.

All these factors combine to generate a more-or-less genderless society. Dwarves will recognize another dwarf's sex based on pheromone compounds, and courtship is done almost exclusively through these compounds. If you see a dozen dwarves in a bar, drinking and laughing and bellowing at each other, there is a high chance that a number of them are sexually female, and some of them may well be getting lucky later.

Other races are essentially incapable of differentiating between male and female dwarves, and it doesn't really matter for their purposes, anyway. Father, brother, and son are their translated terms, and from a non-dwarf's perspective, they might as well all be male.","I don't know that I would personally use that in my own campaign, but it's well-reasoned and I like it!",dndmemes
I read a theory about dwaren beards acting as filters for all the bad gases while mining which lead to female dwarves having them as well.

"If the vampire converted, would he still be repelled by a cross? Or by a symbol of Pelor instead? Would an atheist vampire not me repelled by any religious symbol?","Depends on the type of vampire we’re talking about. As a kid I read a story about a vampire didn’t want to take a life and went to seek refuge from a religious house many miles from his home so no one would recognize him. Once the priests and pastors saw he was being truthful they gave him residence in their church and only allowed a few to know what he really was and would offer him blood from their hands (small blood letting cuts normal for the time). The vampire would only take what he needed to survive and nothing more.
Well the main church heard about this and went to confront the small church and everyone was freaking out including the vampire. The priest of the small church had an idea to cover the vampire in a holy robe so he could attempt to great the accusers in the light of day and it actually worked.
The accusers were tried for lying and the vampire (getting a headache) went to go lay down in his crypt and just seemed to sleep from then on. The end of the story was that during the Nazi Invasion when they armies came in to take holy relics the vampire woke up and took all the holy relics of the area and went back to his crypt where no soldiers were will go.",dndmemes

TBF after a certain point its a fair question,"And that’s why a good DM will reskin/home brew everything, that way players can’t actually know for sure what will or won’t hit, nor how much HP it has which more allows you to adjust things on the fly if the party is too strong or weak for an expected encounter. If the players know exactly what an enemy is, all sense of tension and fun is gone.

Example, the party runs into a pair of medium sized lizard creatures. You have no idea if these are some weak squishy “fire drakes” or the muthafucking gigachad Toothless who’s about to fuckup your whole world.

25 AC is easy to reach for a Shield-casting mid-level Eldritch Knight, but there are literally only two monsters in the entire game that can match that, and almost all the other monsters have an AC of 22 or less.

"Once had a trap in a dungeon that was a gate with the word ""pull"" painted above it. The paint's color was such that it could not be seen with darkvision (since darkvision doesn't perceive color).

Pulling the gate made it open without consequence. Pushing it set off a fireball trap. If the party used a light source, they would easily see the instruction to pull the door open. If they relied solely on darkvision, they had a 50/50 shot of setting off the trap.

They did not use a light. My one experienced player was the one who said he opened the gate, and panicked when I asked him if he pulled or pushed it open. Fortunately for him, he pulled.

The second party to run that dungeon also did not use a light. They pushed.","So, how angry was the second party?",dndmemes
"I'm in the personal opinion that if you don't have the forethought to ask if the door is locked or trapped, or to state you are opening it ""carefully"" then you deserve to trigger the trap or alert what's on the other end.

Pretending it loudly slams open when you want is unfair. Assuming that they open it normally is mostly fair, unless stated otherwise. With the caviat if they do something like I sneak up to the door and open it. It is fair to assume stealth is being used here and a follow up question is warrented as players assumptions on thier wording should not automatically be punished.

"the problem with paladins though is that they don’t do any of that the best. they don’t have the tank abilities of a barbarian, the magic damage of a sorcerer, warlock or wizard, the healing of a cleric or druid or the physical damage of a fighter or rouge. we can do a lot of things but we don’t do any of them the best. jack of all trades, master of none. except maybe tanking, in my current session i have the highest AC by 1 but i also have some of the lowest health because i rolled bad on constitution and my barbarian has 60+ more health than i do with only 1 less AC so not being the best tank is kinda my fault","There's a strong argument for the tanking capabilities of paladin over barbarian. If you use your lay on hands on yourself, you mostly make up for the hit points difference, and it's generally unlikely that you wouldn't have more AC. Paladins don't need to use two handed weapons for satisfying damage like barbarians,   either by taking dueling, or by relying on their ability to smite. Even if you do, plate with defense fighting style (great weapon fighting isn't as worth it), gives you two AC over a barbarian's half plate (their unarmored defense probably doesn't beat that out). Plus, reckless attack, which makes up a strong portion of the barbarian's offensive arsenal, significantly limits the value of the AC barbarians have. 

Throw on the fact that paladins get a huge bonus to saves thanks to aura of protection, plus spells that can enhance their durability like shield of faith, and they're really standing up in terms of durability. Granted, they're fairly resource dependent and have fairly little resources to go around, while barbarians don't really struggle to keep their rage up for significant fights.",dndmemes

Untrained hirelings are capable of performing menial work that requires no particular skill, such as laborers, porters, and maids (though I'd argue you need a certain amount of skill to be a maid, but that's the example in the book).

[*An elven wizard casually commits war crimes on a group of goblins.*]

**Wizard**: Look, several low level minons. OBSERVE, as I cast an appropriately levelled spell and save bigger spells for later.

**Panel 2**

[*A Tortle Monk in a battle stance looks on skeptically as the Wizard makes a placating gesture with his hands.*]

**Monk**: But that one passed his save.

**Wizard**: And that's okay. Because we know he's not very tough so we can just take him down next round.

**Panel 3**

[*Split panel showing the deranged Monk and exasperated Wizard arguing while a lone goblin stands amidst his scorched companions*]

**Monk**: ...But he PASSED his SAVE. That means he's tough.

**Wizard**: No, it's perfectly normal.

**Monk**: He could kill us on his turn.

**Wizard**: No, he can do a few HP at most and we have potions.

**Monk**: ...He needs to be stopped.

**Wizard**: No. The LICH needs to be stopped. And we can't afford ANOTHER short rest.

**Monk**: Master, Forgive me. But I'll have to go all out... Just this once.

"hm, is there a way to get +10 to hit at level 1? Not accounting for like, bardic inspiration and other such things, but a consistant perma self sustained +10?

\+7 from prof and a 20 in your attack stat. (18+2 from race for your state, 4d6dl for rolling)...

maybe a magic weapon? But that doesnt sound right. magic items are for nerds...

i got nothing atm",Archery fighting style could get you to +9. We're almost there,dndmemes
"Hmmmmmm, getting over a +10 to hit on a level one character is real tricky. 

The highest stat bonus you can get with the current 5e rules at level 1 is a +3  unless you (used to be plus 4 but changelings got nerfed) unless you roll and get a 16-17-18 and that isn't power gaming, that's just being lucky. If you take V-Human you can get a feat as well, which can give you a bonus to hit or a half feat. The half feat doesn't help you at level 1 though since the best you can do there is take a 16 and turn it into a 17 and that doesn't increase your to hit, but you can get fighting initiate and get a +2 to ranged attack roles with Archery fighting style, though you can get that anyway by just being a fighter. Maybe take martial adept instead. 

V-human fighter with martial adept. You get at +3 from stat bonus + 2 from proficiency, +2 from archery fighting style. You also have 1 use of precision strike per short rest which adds an average of 3.5 to your to hit. So that does get you to a 10.5 average to hit, but you are only guaranteed a +8 to hit and you can only do it once per short rest. I guess anything is possible if you roll for stats though.","Another comment chain rolled for stats, but they got:

Custom Lineage for +2 dex

Feat is Fighting Initiate for Archery fighting style

as a DM and a 'top' and a Dominant this is cruel. To think that a Top would consciously abuse the trust of their players under the pretext of 'fun' is wrong.

Being a DM is about having the trust of your players to run an enjoyable encounter that is safe, fun and leads to fond memories. Much as being a Top/Dom (which a commenter has pointed out are not interchangeable) is about reciprocal trust.

"The first campaign I ever played in, back in 2nd edition, wasn't a very serious thing. The DM would throw wacky stuff at us and we'd adapt the best we could; it was very sandbox.

I played a Warpriest (not quite a paladin, more like a cleric that insisted on standing in the front when they really shouldn't) and we ended up against some big-ass red dragon. Everyone else knew that we had no chance against it at our level, so they went to run. I literally couldn't run away because of my war god, so I accepted my character was going to die and charged the dragon. The party cast whatever buffs they could on me as they fled.

2e had some broken shit. Enlarge Person was a literal multiplier on your damage, among other details I don't remember so well. I managed it critically hit it, doing a bunch of damage. But of course, it's a dragon with a LOT of health. Another player notes that I did *just* enough damage to trigger a Massive Damage check, to see if it died outright from system shock. The DM laughs because it's a friggin' dragon, and gives it a 99% chance to pass the roll.

Well, you know how it went because I'm bothering to tell this story. The table cheers wildly because I unexpectedly OHKO'd a red dragon *way* beyond our scope. He describes be becoming gigantic and just beheading the whole thing, and I'm already hooked on D&D for life.

Then the player who knew the rules properly speaks up again, because he had whatever was needed to craft armor and shit out of materials. So he and the DM consult the relevant bits, and he says he can try and craft me armor out of it. I am clearly into this, so he rolls some crafting check. I'm not too certain how this bit worked, but he somehow critically crafted my armor, meaning it was masterwork. In 2e, this was super important for one big reason: only masterwork armor can be enchanted.

We ended up going from a sandbox campaign into us all hunting for a way for me to get my critical dragonplate armor enchanted. This came to a head when we found a djinn who offered a single wish, and I wished for it to be enchanted ""befitting my exploits"". (I figured I'd give the DM free reign to fuck me over here for the fun of it.) The djinn has me take off the armor, he puts it on and glows for a while and the armor somehow looks even fancier. Then the fucker says ""you know, this *is* nice armor"" and teleports away with it.

The back half of the campaign was us hunting that little shit down.",This is great I love it,dndmemes

Giving birth to a centaur foal would pretty much be identical to giving birth to an equine foal. They’d have one continuous spine, our back replacing the neck vertebrae on an equine.",dndmemes
"Depends on if the infant is more horse- or human-like. A human has breasts on their chests because human infants are too small and frail to reach even the waist of an upright adult human; so the infant is held in the arms at breast height.

Horses can run within a few hours of birth and, when standing, a foal's mouth is at a adult horse's breast height.

So, it is very likely that centaurs would breastfeed with horse breasts, not human breasts, because an infant centaur would not be easily carried in the adult's arms (consider how easy you would find it to hold a foal).

Therefore, female centaurs shouldn't biologically develop human-like breasts. Any woman knows that running with free-flying breasts is cumbersome and a burden, so it wouldn't make sense for centaurs to develop completely decorative and non-functional fat sacks at chest height.

All of that said, I hate the breast debates on this sub. Too many people are misunderstanding the harmful prevalence of (mostly) female character sexualization in D&D. If this was an honest inquiry into the sensibility of breast placement and prevalence in fantasy races, I would be all for it; fascinating speculation.

"I'd say they have chosen their oath, and are slowly working towards it to gain that oaths power. Once they hit level 3 they can choose to fully commit or choose a different path.

I justify the level 3 oath features as their dedication to their oath finally yielding oath-specific results.,dndmemes
"I’ve always thought of it as being that the power comes from the conviction of a paladin’s faith, so that unlike a cleric they aren’t “chosen” without putting the work in, but it also requires work as opposed to simply swearing an oath, which anyone can do. The oath is more there kind of as a promise to the god that you’re not gonna use the powers they lend you for things that oppose their moral teachings and are actually do something useful.",This was my understanding as well.

"Just being a devout follower of a God. Paladins geta their specific powers from a specific oath. The actual power comes from a deity and the Paladin being their champion.

"Wow, what an oversight by WoTC. I think I have a solution though, on page 85 of the PHB they should just put a little section in under the Sacred Oath class feature that says something like

Players: ""Why did they use undead""

DM: ""They were users of forbidden magic that let them control them""

Player: ""Why did they use forbidden magic?""

DM: ""Because they accidentally invented it and it was powerful""

Player: ""Why is this forbidden magic powerful""

At this point you can't really say anything but I'm the DM and I say it is or because it is. Which is essentially the same thing.

Another less convoluted example could be that a King's guard is trying to poison the king without anyone knowing. The guard could go, disguise himself and talk with local poisoners, if the party has a magic item that can see through the disguise and then fail the perception check to hear the conversation then the best way to respond to ""Why is the guard talking with the poisoners"" would be ""because he is"". which is essentially the same thing as that.

Looking for lizard tiddies ?,"No that debate needed to go away. We're here for funny jokes about D&D not an all out political war

I'm just happy I can now (somewhat) safely surf this sub at work again",dndmemes
"A very basic introduction:

It's a tabletop game where you and a group of people tell a story where you roleplay as the main characters.

Example:

Imagine the first Avengers movie. One guy shows up with a cool backstory about how his character was frozen in the ice for a few decades, and that he used to fight Nazis. Another guy says his character learned how to build a robot suit in a cave. The next guy plays a big, angry guy who gets more powerful when he gets angry. One dude wants to play a lightning based warrior with a really cool hammer. A few other people join, and you have your party: a Paladin, an Artificer, a Barbarian, and a Cleric.

Now the person running the game, the Dungeon Master, builds the world and all the people in it. He has the NPC, Nick Fury, tell the players that their characters are needed to save the world from an alien invasion! The players start by learning the ropes (there's a small attack on their flying base), and they have to figure out what is going on (turns out the guy leading the invasion is a character's brother!), then they have to figure out how to stop it (there's a magic box that the bad guy is using to open a portal), and then they have to stop the bad guy's army, catch the bad guy, and save the world!

If you want to do something, you roll a 20 sided die (called a d20) and add a few points to it based on how good or bad your character is at that thing. A smart character will add more points to the roll when they're trying to remember some information, and a wise character will add more points when they're trying to see if somebody is lying. If your total is higher than a certain number (as decided by the DM), then you succeed!

Hulk wants to smash the alien's face in? Roll a d20, add +5 because he's strong and good at punching, and maybe you get 18. Hulk needs at least a 16 to smash the alien's face, so he succeeds! He rolls different dice for damage (maybe a six sided die, also adding a few points), the alien takes damage, and it's the next guy's turn.",Good explanation,dndmemes
I have my first ever real session tomorrow at 4. I will soon be fully initiated into the cult that is this sub.,Good luck,dndmemes
Haven’t played since 3.5 I have no friends lol,I feel... your depression,dndmemes
"I've never done anything related to DnD (unless you count playing Divinity Original Sins for 2 hours then gave up) but I still follow memes of this genre because it's funny as hell, especially the struggle of the DM trying to maintain group-sanity.",Very relatable,dndmemes
"Got a homebrew bouncing around in my head where the primary  Lizardfolk political entity is a literally death-worshipping (god of death is also the god of change, challenges, gambling, hunting, journeys too - it's a lil complex), highly organized empire with a distressingly significant military and something of a bone to pick with the nearby human kingdoms for past...territorial disagreements. 

Might have to take a leaf out of your book here tbh.",I'm going with dinotopia - but the people are dinos too. so smol lizards riding big lizards. Maybe chuck in some magic too? Something with leylines.... Nazca dinos?,dndmemes

"My first thought on reading this

Wesley: WRONG. Your ears you keep and I'll tell you why. So that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish. Every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, ""Dear God! What is that thing,"" will echo in your perfect ears. That is what to the pain means. It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.”",Damn that was a good movie,dndmemes
"Interesting idea. Like Cho'gall, has two names, one for each head — Cho and Gall.

How would it work though...","Basically we would share the body (AC, HP, etc.) We would each have control of one arm which we could use on our turns for our actions and stuff, or we could forfeit the use of the arm on our turn to let the other use it on their turn.",dndmemes

"I would hope your DM allows it. Clerics have higher wisdom than charisma, therefore would typically have higher insight than intimidation.

I really wish dual wielding was better at higher levels.,"New variant rule igyou want to use it is on YouTube, basically said dual wielding makes no sense in context of 2H weapons and GWM so when you take the attack action and you have 2 attacks, you attack with both weapons as part of one attack so without duel wielding fighting style you don’t get your prof so it’s basically (short swords) 1d6+3 + 1d6 and then you do your second attack and repeat the damage it’s basically a way to keep duel wielding scaling with feats and fighting styles and at later levels gives you a lot more bang for your buck so to speak I mean 2H weapons with GWM are still better because they’re hard hitting weapons but low level and mid game you’re very useful at dealing damage so running a duel wield hero can actually be viable and fun especially when you grab the feat and magic weapons come on to play I just really like the idea and me and my DM will play test it at our table soon enough",dndmemes
I was also incredibly out of the loop so I found this post that sums everything up nicely: https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/lugcr3/tabletop_rpg_the_tragic_ballad_of_adam_koebel_the/,That is helpful. Thanks.,dndmemes
"If you don’t use everything to survive the fight, was it even a fight?","If you use everything to survive this fight, how will you survive the next one?",dndmemes
"Well I mean I think it all depends on everyone’s sense of what they wanted.

Half the session was me roleplaying townsfolk haggling with the players for ornate magical furniture (talking doors, magic mirrors, etc) 

We were laugh/crying the entire time on how absurd it was!!! Paladin haggling with the mother of the local duke on why having a talking door would be the talk of the town and why 300 gold is a steal!!!!

😒 the door didn’t take too kindly to it.",dndmemes
"Okay, but here me out: Sexy snake men with beards",and tits,dndmemes

"Eh, I'm split on that one. Kinda just seems lazy to slap a beard on them just because ""hur hur Dwarf"". Like in my game female Dragonborn all have wings and are smaller, Elves are completely androgynous, and Male Dwarves are all bald with big beards while female dwarves have an absurd amount of head hair.","I can not remember where I first read it but something on the lines of, dwarven women with a little facial is is where it is at....maybe it was L.O.T.R. or it could if been Flint Fireforge from Dragonlance so it was years ago for me. And it has stuck ever since.",dndmemes

Finally. A bard without the horny,The day is still young and he is yet to go to the tavern,dndmemes
So this is what The Bard College in Skyrim was supposed to be! I knew them lute-pluckers were a pack of lyres.,"Biggest disappointment of Skyrim is Bethesda’s seeming inability to actually make a college quest line. I want questlines where I overindulge at a rager, sleep in past my first class and have to attend my second hung over. And then 2 quests later spend half the quest crying over a text book.

In all seriousness tho having an actual college for both the Bard’s college and the CoW with classes and lectures that you can attend to boost skills would be awesome.",dndmemes
Being a bard is so much fun with expertise+jack of all trades. Nothing like having pathfinder-level skill bonuses,Yeah honestly Bard is by far my favourite class I find the versatility from that and magical secrets so fun,dndmemes

And for pacts, I make actual contracts for them to sign which outlines specific things they need to accomplish regularly (none of that boring when you die I get your soul nonsense), and failing to meet their side of the pact causes their powers to become severely weakened until either they fix it or make a new pact.  

And for both, I try to put them in positions that make keeping their oath or pact difficult.  (I’m doing that with my friend’s Fiendlock now.)  If they had both then I’d definitely put them in positions where doing both would be extra difficult.

I’m not trying to take away the fun by doing this.  This should make it more fun.  (My friend playing the fiendlock is loving it.) If they’re not willing to go along with it then they’re probably just being a jerk.  

If they don’t see a way to keep both their oath and their pact, then I’d provide ways for them to either change one or both of them.  My favorite idea for how to do this would be a quest for them to complete (with their allies’ help) while in their weakened state, in which they convince their patron to change the terms of the pact to something more favorable, or for them to find a new patron who is more reasonable.

Edit: if there’s no conflict then this isn’t an issue.  But most oaths will have issues.","> If they’re not willing to go along with it then they’re probably just being a jerk.

"As already stated in this thread siege weapons are classed as objects rather than weapons, but a generous DM could allow this.

Dropping something should deal fall damage to both the dropped item and the target. This maxes out at 20d6, which requires a minimum height of 200ft. Double-moving, this would take an Aaracokra with a 50ft fly speed two turns to go straight up; if the target wasn't directly below it would take a third turn to position above the target.

Even if the DM generously allows an automatic hit - personally I'd say an attack roll isn't out of the question, as 200ft is a long way and there could be winds etc, but I digress - that's now 3 turns spent to deal 20d6, or less than 7d6 per turn on average - not quite so ridiculous anymore. Note Xanathar's specifies a falling speed of 500ft per round, so we can assume the catapult lands in the same turn it was dropped from 200ft up.

20d6 averages at 70 points of damage; it's a lot, more than enough to flatten your average Commoner, Goblin, ir Orc, but a lot of CR5+ monsters have more HP, so it's unlikely to be a one-hit kill on most larger foes from Tier 2 onwards.

Furthermore, the damage will *also* apply to the object; if we take the trebuchet, the largest and toughest catapult, it has 150HP as per the DMG. This means that, on average, it will be destroyed the third time it is used in this way - nothing about bonded weapons prevents them from taking damage.

The Aaracokra can have 2 such weapons bonded at one time; these can be changed on a short rest, but given the trebuchet is a Huge Object practicality dictates this will likely be limited to 2 trebuchets per day - unless the Aaracokra is defending a stationary location that is packed with trebuchets. 

So, we're looking at a total of 240d6 per day from two trebuchets over a 225sqft area (given they are huge objects) i.e. a total damage of 2160d6; by comparison, a Wand of Fireballs deals up to 56d6 per day over 1256sqft, a total damage of 2800d6.

Now, whilst there's no listed cost for a trebuchet, I'd expect it to be in the 2000-5000GP range. Xanathar's has pricing for magic items; a Rare item like the Wand of Fireballs goes for 2d10x1000, averaging 11000GP, so two trebuchets at an ongoing cost of a few thousand each puts this in the same ballpark in the short-term, and vastly more expensive if pursued on a daily basis across an entire campaign!

Therefore, should the DM allow weapon bonding with an object, this is not as ridiculously unbalanced as it seems at first - but it's also not as powerful as imagined.","Appreciate the in depth analysis on the topic, that's very interesting! It seems a lot more functional than I initially thought, especially given that the siege weapons would be able to survive the fall (and you could probably repair them after the combat, given enough time). The time to reach the height to deal max damage is certainly a drawback, but worthwhile against more powerful enemies.

The peep windows and assless plate are close, but I'm not sure they're as close to the sheer problem with undefended or poorly defended vitals as the codpiece would be.

But then you also don't have the problem of the armor actually being negative protection for the vital area too, in that then you can't have chest plate that crunches your sternum. So I would lean into the chainmail bikini but for guys thing and propose codpiece, then plate pasties for over the dude nipples, with a knife welded uselessly and hazardously between them.",dndmemes
"Boob-accommodating armor totally makes sense, and just as women have differing preferences in bra's it makes sense they would have individual preferences in armor style as well.

And if we separate it out into two boob plates, you're making it less effective by either building in a severe structural weakness, or you're making it too bulky by attaching extra metal in suggestion of boobs.

Other ways that the empire has acquired large sums of money is through the war between the holy nation and the empire. Most of the money lines the pockets of the nobles and the emperor himself but a faction far in the north aims to change that. The current war between the empire and the holy nation has hit a stalemate. With the holy nation fighting a war on 3 fronts yet their religious zealotry keeps them unbreakable. Their prejudice however is another problem for any vagabond traveler as the roads in the holy nation are lines with the crucified remains of non-humans left to the vultures and crows. While all human are generally leaning towards the holy nation, the ones who are magically gifted or knowledgeable of the arcane tend to stay away from there as they will also meat the cross and the righteous fire of the holy flame.

"I'm in a new group (2 sessions in) & one of the players posted a pic, which clearly shows blackfacing. 

I told them, that this is blackfacing & racist. They told me they didn't understand why. (Big ufff) Then the player continues to explain that this is just someone cosplaying their character (which apparently is a drow) & it should be totally fine cause its an fictional race... bla bla. Some others joined the discussion & sided with him. The other player told me I shouldn't see it out of context & ""its not blackfacing""

Yeah I googled it. Turns out it was in the series ""Community"". The characters (in the show) called the blackfacing out. And asked ""are we just ignoring the hate crime?)""

They literally said its blackfacing!!! I was unsure if it was a good or bad thing to remove the episode, cause they called it out. But then I reminded myself that apparently some ppl are to silly to get that this isn't okay. Even if it's written in the script. And things will be taken out of context.

It's a completely false equivalence to say that both sides are equally at fault for the arguments here. One side literally accused the other of moral failings and was intent on shutting down the expression through art, the other was on the defensive and only wanted to retain their ability to continue expressing their artistic preferences without being labelled sexist. The worst argument that the snake-tiddy crowd made was virtue signalling on the other side, which isn't remotely the same degree of insulting.

This was really great for players on a budget because (especially in the days before easy pdf piracy) if you only cared about playing tieflings rogues, you could just buy the tiefling book and the rogue book.

"Hello all! These are some recent memes of our DnD session drawn by one of our lovely artists. The party consists of a pair of elves (one being slightly dumb), a tiefling, and a human barbarian fellow seen aloof through random encounters as part of our 'pirating' ocean adventure campaign set in my world. We all thought it was amazing enough to cry in chat and laugh about some of the scenes, I decided to share. Please enjoy!

"Honestly, the whole argument is kind of dumb. (entertaining, but dumb) It boils down to trying to decide exactly what the biology of a fictional species is. Sure, a lamia is a reptile and dragonborn are specifically known to lay eggs, but these species are still partially humanoid. (Or part human in the case of many dragonborn.) So, how much is human and how much isn't? Unless it's specifically stated in world, how do you know whether or not when a dragonborn baby is hatched whether or not they still need breastplate. Many real species feed off of their mother for long after their born. (Admittedly, those are live birth species, not eggs. However, humans are live birth and both species I listed above are similar enough to humans that the comparison can be made.) Ultimately, I think it comes down to things like the color of a tiefling or whether or not a dragonborn has a tail. Unless there's a specific reason, let the player determine what they look like. Just like how people look different, magical species could have variations in how the look too.","People have said again and again that their problem isn’t realistic biology, it’s the constant  need to sexualise female characters beyond reason and all the excuses people make up to do it. There’s no other reason a snake lady would be drawn with tits than being pleasing to the eyes of the people looking at it. All other reasons given to explain it is really just excuses to have them have tits. 

It’s the same energy as Quiet from metal gear solid who’s almost naked *because she breathes through her skin so she can’t wear clothes* like,  we all know it’s the other way around, the developers made it so she breathes through her skin to give her a reason to be naked. 

I don’t care all that much about snitties, it’s a fun meme, like you said it’s dumb but entertaining, and everybody like boobs, it’s all harmless debates, but really people are debating two different things. Personally I think you can give your snake lady tits the same way you can give Dragonborns tails, *you* decide what *your* characters look like in *your* game, but all the more reason for official art to be titless, this way the implications dont make people uncomfortable and people who do want snitties can just add them in their head canon",dndmemes

So..... No tittie suckle then 🤔,But still plenty of tittie to nuzzle,dndmemes
Ok but that would mean the guys have them too,"Chin balls!

Guys have chin balls!",dndmemes
There are in fact German folk tales about crones who kill people by forcing them to drink from their poisoned tiddies.,"Mate, that's astounding!

"""They're venom sacks!""  


""They're evolutionarily developed extra padding for the chest!""  


""They're a lure technique developed to ensnare races that like tits!""  


No... no. No, they're just tits and you thirsty mf'ers are desperately clawing for excuses to keep them in your games. There's no reason the first two need to be boobs except that you *want* them to. And the third should be body horror, but lets be real, it isn't.","Have you considered that it’s just the simplest way to show whether something is male or female?

Tieflings aren’t evil by nature. That paladin is just racist lol.,"I wonder how far you could push this. With a character that is just racist against ""evil"" races, and and that by coincidence puts him on the right side of the law *usually*",dndmemes
"That paladin is lawful evil, not good.","Is he though? I think that's where the alignment system kinda breaks down. If he's always seeking to do good for all (except the tieflings) is he really evil? He's certainly not neutral as he's making an active effort to do good.

Is alignment more about how the character views themselves? How the world views them? Or is there some absolute judgement that can decide what is good and evil? Does him being racist to tieflings outweight all the good he has done?

I feel like evil/good is more about intent than the action itself. A wolf isn't evil for killing their prey, a human is evil for *wanting* to kill an innocent person.

In this case, if this paladin was taught that all tieflings are evil, and he truly believes that, is he good, even though he does bad things? Or is he bad, despite his noble intentions?",dndmemes

Activity Corner (Druid Edition)

Today’s Activity: Transport via Plants Prank

&#x200B;

Here’s a fun prank you can play on some people with the help of an 11th level Druid!  Let’s walk through the steps together, see if you can guess how the prank works before we get to the end!

1. Transport via Plants doesn’t specify the size of the destination plant.
2. Even if it still has to be Large - which, again, it doesn't say - there's nothingabout its size in relation to the departure plant. 
3. Once through, it doesn't allow travel back the other way so if something tries to forceyou back you just squish into the tree. 
4. It doesn't create a discrete opening, so people can enter from all sides. 
5. You can fit a lot of people around a giant redwood and they can all be poised to charge through. 
6. You can tell them they're going to another giant redwood, but then send them to small tree in an enclosed courtyard.  What a hilarious prank!",Is this the equivalent of a bunch of people trying to squeeze through a doorway at the same time?,dndmemes
I mean what happens if a lot of matter is squished with infinite force into a space that is to small? it Would it be compressed right? Soon let's say I send a Horse and a man in a redwood tree and let them exit out of a sapling. They would be forced into a smaller space till that space ruptures. If provided with a endless force and the space not Rupturing that would mean instant matter compression. So they either explode out of a sapling or turn up highly compressed maybe even as diamonds. Which... Sounds lucrative. Let's turn bandits to diamonds lol,"Worth a shot, it's not like there's a bandit shortage.",dndmemes
"Other casters hate they don't have meta-magic, and they can die jealous.",And then the wizard takes metamagic adept and learns empowered spell.,dndmemes
I didn't ask how big the room is; I said I cast fireball.,Basically 😂,dndmemes
"First cast fireball, if anyone is still standing, another fireball to burn the consequences 🔥",👏,dndmemes
"Fun Fact: familiars can use magic items.

Completely unrelated Fun Fact: Wand of Fireballs exists",Gave my owl familiar a ring of spell storing and keep a cast of haste in it. The party samurai suddenly became a big fan of birds.,dndmemes
"If I remember this correctly from QI pulling the pin of a grenade takes roughly the same force as picking up 4-5kg
So that better be a strong ass bird",Assuming the high end that’s roughly 11 pounds. One of the more common bird familiars is an owl. The great horned owl is capable of grabbing lifting off and flying with 4-5 times their own weight. The a barrage weight of the great horned owl is 3.2 pounds multiplied by 4.5 (average between the two factors) gets us 14.4 pounds. So it seems to me an owl would be quite capable of such a feat. Larger birds of prey such as hawks and eagles would likely fair similarly or even better.,dndmemes
Artificer - Not again,The Artificer dip makes so much sense now.,dndmemes
"Emphasis on *nearly*, if he lived then it all worked out in the end, lmao. That’s what my fighter Barbarian did with another artifact, cost him an arm.","Ah, the cleric was fortunate to get away with a sore head and a lecture from the ranger. There will be... more repurcussions down the line however...",dndmemes
A comic. It was started by a couple of comics.,Saw the post by the mod just now. First I thought it was something Wotc had posted on their socials that had sparked it,dndmemes
Reminds me of the kind of profile pictures old people use on Facebook.,I still don't understand why some of them like to aim their camera *perfectly* so that their head looks like melting ice cream.,dndmemes
I don't know the lore. Would Tasha be just as confused about cameras as anyone else? Or does she tinker with stuff?,She might make a youtube channel of her witchy pranks,dndmemes
"Continuously burn someone and heal them so as they slowly heal the damaged nerve endings they can feel them burn away, over and over and over again.","Okay, calm down there Satan.









But keep going, I'm intrigued",dndmemes
Well. No. The revived one has to be willing to come back to life.,In 5e that is only true of the higher level resurrection spells. Revivify just does it's thing whether they want to or not. RAW at least. DM mileage may vary on that.,dndmemes
"Well, it WOULD work... Just saying.","Torture isn't particularly effective, they will often say what they think you want to hear just to stop the pain.",dndmemes
"As a DM I rule torture is only wrong because the information given can be false so you truthfully have no gain in it. 

But if you have a Zone of Truth and they aren't feeling chatty when they fail the save... Then its not torture, just loosening the mouth!","Fun fact: The only times the US government has admitted to gaining information via torture it turned out that the prisoners had given false information. Better ways to get accurate information is to either make the prisoner think that they gave up real info or let them know that you've made sure the group they're a part of thinks they flipped. Or, y'know, do what that one nazi interrogator did and treat them like they're people.",dndmemes
"The real reason we don't go with Cleric's plan is because it gets very expensive, very quickly.

Cleric, to Rogue as he hands off a money pouch: ""Run down to the market and buy another five 300gp diamonds.""

Rogue: ""Got it. *Buy* diamonds.""

Cleric, who has already made it abundantly clear that he does not want crime to follow in the party's wake: ""Wait, why did you say it like that?""

Rogue: ""... because that's what you asked me to do?""

\*Cleric casually kills the bad guy again while staring Rogue in the eyes\*

Cleric: ""Yes. Yes. I. did.""","That's why you don't actually kill them, just bring them to the brink of death and continually heal them back to consciousness.

Maybe one death if they're being really uncooperative ~~or you're okay with the rogue's sticky fingers.~~",dndmemes
"Isn't there a spell to make corpses answer questions? 

Also, you know, mind control spells that are both way easier and more humane?","Easier, yes. Humane? Not so sure about that. Enchantment is easily the most evil and depraved school of magic there is. Necromancy might animate some dead meat, but Enchantment scrambles peoples brains and forces them to do what you want as early as 2nd level spells.",dndmemes

DM whips out a carbobus demon who manifests garlic bread to tempt the weak asexual character.,"DM: ""A figure starts walking toward you in the dark-""

Elf Rogue: ""I have darkvision.""

DM: ""You want that coin purse you found to actually be full of sleeping mimics instead of gold?""

Elf Rogue: ""Uuuuh...""

DM: ""Then let me finish. Anyway. A figure starts walking toward you in the darkness. It emanates a strange and uncanny aura. Whoever has the highest score, Roll Arcana.""

Cleric: ""That'll be an 18.""

DM: ""Neat, before you even fully see the figure, you can identify it as an incubus instinctively.""

Fighter: ""Oh, that's not so bad. Almost all of us are men. Sorry Katie. And I think we're all straight.""

Sorcerer girl: ""Ah, well, actually I heard that an incubus can change shapes, so none of us is safe.""

Smug Ace barbarian: ""I'm an asexual actually. So even if he changes form, I'm good.""

Dm, smirking: ""The figure, at last, steps into your torch light. He's a slightly overweight, olive skinned, middle aged man with a chevron mustache. He wears a white button up coat, an apron, and a tall white hat. He's carrying a trey with him.""

Sorcerer girl: ""Wait, he's a fat old Italian guy? I guess I don't have to be too worried.""

Barbarian: ""Oh- oh no... He's not after you.""

DM: ""The incubus lefts the lid on his tray to reveal a plate of hand-crafted spaghetti and meat balls, garnished with zucchini and served with a side of homemade garlic bread. Also on the plate is a small grater and a chunk of fresh parmesan. Instinctively you know that all ingredients involved are locally sourced, fresh and of only the highest quality.""

Ace barbarian: ""Oh holy high hell...""

Everyone else: ""Don't do it man!""

DM: The incubus asks if you 'would like to touch his spaghetti' and holds the trey out toward you. Make a will save.

Ace barbarian: ""No... No man. It wouldn't be right if I passed that save. There's just no way."" 

DM: ""Very well. Your axe clatters to the ground. The incubus's other minions crawl up the tunnel while you take the trey and move to the side of the chamber. You are out of the fight until the trey is finished. This will likely take several minutes.""

Fighter: ""I knock the trey from-""

DM: ""Alright, you move to, but I'm going to let you roll insight first.""

Fighter: ""Oh. Uh oh. Ok. Umm... Oh! Natural twenty.""

DM: ""Should you take the barb's food away, he will prioritize killing you until either you or the incubus is dead.""

Fighter: ""Ah... In that case, I don't do that.""

DM/Ace: ""Smart choice.""",dndmemes
"wait, player, or character? the meme says player, the context seems to imply character, and I hope to god it's character.",Character. I may not be good at wordsmithing but other versions sounded too cumbersome,dndmemes
"And.

No, that doesn't mean either one, I need both.  Simultaneously.  For ... reasons.",An Omnibus?,dndmemes
"Both, as long as they roll above a 1.",I'd take both even if they roll a 1 tbh,dndmemes
"I know that the distinction between the two is actually whether or not they’re a top or a bottom, but a lot of people still see succubus vs incubus as whether or not the demon is male or female.   


With that said I do think there’s probably funny memes about finding out your friend is a bottom when the “top” demon is the one that gets them.","You could just have a session zero where you ask your players how much sexual content they are comfortable with having in their game along with whether they prefer anything to be in the foreground, background, or a mix. Like are they fine with flirty barmaids or romancing princesses as long as the sexual acts are described as ""You have a enjoyable time together.""?  
Depending on the campaign you may need to bust out my trusty rusty sexual alignment chart. Instead of Good/Evil and Law/Chaos you have Straight/Bi/Gay and Dom/Non/Sub. It has the same 3x3 grid as the regular D&D alignment but tells you alot more about what a character is into for bedroom stuff. These could also be secret if people aren't big on sharing like that. It came in handy the one (and only) time I ran an erotic fantasy campaign.",dndmemes
"I honestly would be ok with either. I’d prefer the incubus, but a sexy demon is a sexy demon, and I’m a horny player","Technically succubi and incubi aren’t demons, devils, or yugoloths, if I remember correctly. They’re most certainly fiends, but they’re spread throughout the lower planes anywhere they think they can find some advantage. 

Anyway, my pedantic two cents.",dndmemes
">asking them if a succubus and/or an incubus would tempt them

No.  *laughs in asexual*",How about one that offered freshly baked bread?,dndmemes
"Its 2021 - increased likelihood of getting an answer ""neither. Im sapiosexual""

Unless you’re saying that you can’t fathom not going for both, which is a mood,",dndmemes
Is asking about a player or charcters sexuality not nice?,"I mean, nothing wrong with talking about sexuality between friends, right?",dndmemes
"Wasn't the main difference between the two being top or bottom? Usually portrayed in male/female, but that's just the form they take.","Yeah, I believe it's the Latin etymology where Incubus implies top, and Succubus implies bottom, and as they're shape shifters it's not like they have to be specifically the male and female they're portrayed as in the MM.",dndmemes

"Dude I just like tits 

Fleshy Is preferred to scaly but I’m cool with anything but furry",Disney's Maid Marion will be so disappointed.,dndmemes
"I always thought the term furries referred almost exclusively to the people who dress up in animal costumes. A quick search reveals a much broader definition, including (1) “fans of anthropomorphic animals. These are animals with human characteristics, like Mickey Mouse, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many mascots for sports teams”, and (2) “interested in anthropomorphic animal characters with human personalities and characteristics”       

With these in mind, I am reluctantly admitting to being a furry I guess. I’ve spent too many years loving books, cartoons, comics, and video games to deny my interest in characters like bugs bunny, TMNT, patrick star, Sonic, Khajiits and Argonians, etc.      

There is likely a strong inference to sexualized furry culture from the vast amount of material we’ve been exposed to on the web. But is a furry just someone who is interested in anthropomorphic characters? If so... who ISN’T a furry these days?       

[source 1](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/furries/).     

[source 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom).       

Genuinely curious, because if furries ARE exclusively the costumed orgy attendees at convention centers, I retract my previous identification as one.","I think it’s hard to say because furry is more of a cultural word than a concrete one (ie: you can’t really debate what a tree is, a tree is a tree) so it really depends on who you ask, I was just making a meme so I have no clue 😂",dndmemes

And I don't mean he started but only got halfway through. He logged into roll20 and started the character 20 minutes before game start.",For a wizard that’s fairly impressive to do it so fast,dndmemes
Why do you want their sheets? I just want backstories.,"Several reasons for a GM to want character sheets:

1. To make sure that everyone is building their characters correctly. For new players, this is because they can, and frequently do, read the rules improperly.
2. To make sure there is no cheating going on. Sad, but sometimes necessary.
3. To know the group’s strengths and weaknesses. If there’s no PC with good social skills, the quests might focus much more on physical exploration, problem solving, and combat.
4. To hand the sheet off to another table-member if one player happens to be absent for the week. As a GM, I’ve only cancelled due to severe illness or the week of Christmas-New Years for seeing family. Otherwise, if you as a player are absent, we run your character, because I build my challenges anticipating four PC’s so by the gods four PC’s will engage the enemies.",dndmemes

"Would this even work? I mean, can familiars use weapons to attack? Because if they can, then this gets all the yeses that I can give.","any object they can carry also becomes invicisible and the warlock allows a few diffrent forms for the ''find familiair'' spell when they take ''pact of the chain''. such as sprite or imp,  that can carry weapons. both of these can also become invisible by themselves

do take in mind they will reveal themselves if they attack.",dndmemes

Lizardmen men hould have tiddies too then imo,You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.,dndmemes
"Nah.  It's not uncommon among lizards for the female to be the larger of the sexes.  That big scaly tank towering over the rest of the tribe is actually the female, and the males have developed chest growths as a form of fertility display.  They aren't tits, they're chesticles.",So they’re chestnuts?,dndmemes
Honestly this is the most interesting take I've heard so far. 10/10,"While it seems to offer a possibility, it bears no biological reasoning. Such a feature would require an immense reconstruction of the lizards chest, making it extremely, nearly impossible to be developed. Nature tends to not invent ""new"" thing but stick with features that are already present altering them for new requirements. And this would just be ridiculous.",dndmemes
"Or, you know, attract mates. Like birds and flowers",I remember seeing an explanation that they do it to be more like humans and be more accepted by said humans.,dndmemes
"Yaun-ti it makes sense, but Dragonborn and Lizardfolk shouldn’t","dragonborn came from human people, according to the lore. so It actually does make sense.",dndmemes
"It's hilariously futile arguing science and genetics in a fantasy universe where anything can be hand waved by ""fucking magic.""

"For those curious, we can see that the reptilian races still care for their young for multiple years, which is a trait commonly associated with mammals, made easier due to mammary glands. Lactation in mammals has led to stronger bonds between mother and young which also laid the groundwork for complex societies. Finally, the facial dermal muscles used for expressions arose as a requirement of suckling.

However how many teats a mammal has is usually about double the average number of offspring. If reptilian races are laying multiple eggs at once, they'd need more teats to sustain their young.",You want pictures for that or would you like to browse for research material yourself? x),dndmemes

Obviusly there are other ways to be intimidating, such as things like ""it would be as shame if the lord were to hear about this"" from the bard or a socially connect high cha character.   


what about a wizard, threatening some magical response?   


i guess this is where the DM adjust the dc or gives you a bonus?","If we are being technical about RAW, the DM first decides which of the 6 abilities is relevant, and then what proficiencies should be applied. Also there is the variant rule which allows skills proficiencies to be applied to ability checks where they don't usually apply. This means that as the DM if the wizard is intimidating them through magic jargon, or a barbarian through their physical presence, you can choose to make it an Intelligence or Strength check, and then whether they can add an intimidation proficiency.",dndmemes

"Late to this thread but kinda curious. How often does your dm or you as a dm actually go into the physically of most pcs or npcs? When I dm’d I feel like most descriptive text I shared with players would be based around clothing/armor, weapons, general vibe, bedraggled-ness and maybe what their face looked like (like singular details like a scar or a very hooked nose). In the current campaign I play in every single guy could be packing a horse cock and every woman could be a big tittle goth girl and we literally would never know because the most descriptive we would get is “very attractive”. How often is “and she has huge tits” actually said as part of a description in y’all’s games?

What’s wrong with the male gays?,I love you,dndmemes
"Honestly I agree with you. I've always believed sexy characters have a place in fiction but it gets annoying when *every* adult female character in *every* piece of media has to be sexy. 

Like, succubi and seelie fey make sense to be sexy but why does *Every. Damn. Woman.* have to have to have a porn star body?

I think the main argument people I am making is sexualization has always been out of hand in ""male nerd"" culture. Every female character has to be cute or sexy for no justifiable reason.

Lizardfolk have tits for no other reason than for the male viewer to get off to. That can be reasonable in the right circumstances, but is very invasive in a non-porno setting. It's just not needed in the mainstream and makes you look like a horny neckbeard (sorry not sorry.)

I'm gonna point out that all the ""female gaze"" movies brought up here are romance. It makes sense to have hot guys in a romance novel. In mainstream works, guys can look all kinds of ways. You're just nitpicking","> Like, succubi and seelie fey make sense to be sexy but why does Every. Damn. Woman. have to have to have a porn star body?

Things like whicheverubi looking like generically attractive folk doesn't really work for me, because their thing is that that they look attractive *to their targets*; it just shows a lack of imagination, really. So there are dangerously over- or under-weight whicheverubi. There are heavily-muscled and twinky whicheverubi. There are dom, sub, top, bottom, feeder, pet, whicheverubi. There are gendered, agender, cisgender, transgender, whicheverubi. In a world with so many different sentient races, there are whicheverubi that look like any of 'em. If there is a fetish, a whicheverubi can do it, because that's literally their *entire thing*.

Basically I want more variations in whicheverubi than the red-skinned athletic hornyfolks (Which, admittedly, work great for me).",dndmemes

Maybe because I am so much not like this as a guy and I only have one person who does that is a woman I kind of have a different Bias on that

But I'd also like to bring up that, if it's okay with everyone in the group, exploring romantic options might be good for interesting plot twists or hostage stuff or something.

"One thing is sexualizing real people, another is having fantasies about fictional characters, don't really see the problem honestly. Heck, there's an entire genre about sexualizing men for women (romance novels).","DnD doesn’t have a target demographic in the same way that romance/smut does. Romance novels are targeted towards females except for the ones that are targeted towards males or towards teens. DnD shouldn’t be targeted towards men or women, yes originally it was mostly guys playing but we’ve come so far since then. Really your game should be targeted towards the demographic that’s playing it, your players. But even if your players are all dudes in my opinion it’s still worth examining the tropes you use not only will it create a more open environment for anyone who might want to join the community it might just give your games that much more depth.

"Yes, yes and yes.
And if I may drop my 2 cents on this, there is still a really big gap between lizard women having breasts and them being sexualized. I know that's stupid to some degree because I bet that any person putting tiddies on lizards does this to titillate, BUT I'd argue that the existence of breasts doesn't have to be sexualized constantly.
Like, I saw this artwork of a female loxodon cleric here, who definitely had breast under her robes, but the character overall was sure as hell not depicted in a sexualized way.
The whole ""do breasts on a lizard human make sense biologically, or does the anthropomorphication justify their existence"" is secondary and for the most part just a joke.","The point was the joke comes from the instances of hypersexualization, not the debate over biology.",dndmemes
"Nah get your bs outta here dude no reason to make a simple meme about politics or philosophy it's a humanoid creature in order to relate to it we have defining features that help us identify Male and female the easy way is to add breasts it's not the Male gaze you guys keep blabbing on about it's just designers and artists making it easier for the viewer to identify whether the character is Male or female now is their people who go out of their way to make smut yes but it goes both ways not even beginning to talk about lesbians or other sexualities that find women attractive or the thousands of female artists that draw nsfw content and if you want to pull up the it's disproportionate argument many things are very disproportionate just because it is what it is it happens and there is virtually almost nothing you can do to change it in reality

"Not sure I agree..

I've been in a lot of games where everyone wanted a player out but no one wanted to be the one who spoke up first.","that's for that group to deal with tho, an outsider of the group cannot kick him out either. 

It's a difficult situation, but it's still a situation where the only opinions that matter are the ones within the group.",dndmemes
"This ain’t it. 

This whole thing started as a discussion of the harms to the hobby we all love that are brought by the Male Gaze. To dismiss that, as you’re doing, is irresponsible. 

As counterintuitive as it might seem, making a community more inclusive generally requires the expulsion of those that oppose inclusivity. This debate is about helping to make our bebreasted comrades feel less like objects and more like the wonderful humans that they are. Patriarchy is one hell of a drug, and nobody said that detox was going to be fun or easy, but we’ll all be better for it. 

Now, the following is more of a general statement, but it can be applied to this situation, but is mainly a direct response to the meme that OP posted:

There can and should be lines that we as a community shouldn’t cross, and we can and should shun those that willingly cross them.","You’d have a point if only the hobbie in question wasnt a tabletop game where not only you dont see such aspects most of the time (only in fanart...and fanart is not general) but also a game qhere you don’t even see the people playing it. 

Dnd is not a tv show, its not a book, its not a comic, its not a media that people who arent involved in it directly can see, forcing other groups to change in a media that does not affect anybody outside of said group in any way (unless you apply a massive slippery slope fallacy) is more toxic than whatever the group is doing. 

“Explusion of those opposing inclusivity”... i have not seen a single person arguing “you MUST have tits on your snake people” , i have seen the “if i want i can put tits on them”... its different, and its not opposing inclusivity, is just using the design you want to play, i doubt any of those people would throw a tantrum if they encounter a snake-woman without breasts, its just that they want to make one with them. 
 
This is overblown and not worth discussing it in such a manner: “patriarchy” and “objectification” are terms that shouldn’t be thrown around lightly, and i do not think they apply here: fan-service (though weird) is not inherently negative as long as the character is MORE than just fan-service. And humanized creatures can lean more on the human side or the creature side, so how clos you want them to be “human” and how “atractive from the human perspective” you want that creature to be is up to you. 

As a community the dnd one is a tricky one, because it’s not an organized beehive where what one individual does affect the rest or the reputation of the hobbie, we are not a “group of individuals”, we are a group made out of groups of individual, and the groups inside the group do not have the same culture, sensibilites, political leaning, ideology, filosofy, sense of humor or even common interest on the same forms of storytelling. 

In the end, this community, even as a community, has no right to tell the groups inside the group to change, because what that group does cannot ruin it for the others, they are disconnected. In other words, this is a fight where only one side is attacking without the need for it",dndmemes

You can also say that the item can only be activate or attuned after they’ve done a specific quest (the one they need the item for) and until then the item doesn’t work.","I had a recurring travelling merchant in one of my games with a ton of magical items for sale.

I had expected the Rogue would try to steal something from his cart the first time they met. So I planned that all the items he had for sale would have curses on them, which he would dispel as soon as the item had been purchased. (If things took a worse turn, he had a fairly hefty stat-block I could pull up to administer a serious spanking before he disappeared for good.)

So when he appears, imagine my surprise when it’s not the Rogue, but the Ranger who tries to snag an item from the cart. He rolls high on Sleight and steals an item, the player literally sticks his finger up at me and laughs, thinking he’s got one over.

"I've recently thought about multiclassing my level 5 echo knight into Monk, because he's in serious need of meditation and anger management.

RP and whirlwind of death? I can't wait for level 7 haha.","So 5th level fighter gives Extra Attack (*2* attacks every time you take the attack action)

2nd level monk gives Martial Arts (*1* unarmed strike as a bonus action) or Flurry of Blows (spend 1 ki for *2* unarmed strikes as a bonus action).  You can't use both so that's only 2 more attacks.

3rd level Echo Knight gives Unleash Incarnation (*1* melee attack by your echo.  # uses per long rest = CON mod)

So if you take the attack action, you get 2 attacks from Extra Attack, 1 attack from Martial Arts (or 2 from Flurry of Blows if you spend a ki point), and 1 attack from Unleash Incarnation.  That's 4 attacks (5 if you spend the ki).  The only way I see you getting 8 is if you Action Surge and attack again (doubles everything, including ki cost and uses of Unleash Incarnation, as long as you have the CON).  You can only do this beast mode once per long rest, but it is 8-10 attacks.

"I would say most art is due to people preferring what they would consider an attractive aesthetic. This works for males and females but both don’t necessarily find the same thing attractive in both sexes. If I am using art for a character I prefer it to be attractive.

I could see an issue if WotC was publishing overly sexualized women in their books. This is not the case though. This is just random internet art. Some used for characters and some for porn. If you are looking at art to be sexually aroused you are going to want art that is arousing to you. We can’t just tell people not to look at art that arouses them if that’s what they are after. 

At the end of the day it’s about censorship. Do you want to censor individual artists creations? If so, then that will take you down a pretty slippery slope.

"In all the good and righteous work to have women be seen as more than sex objects, we must neither erase women who enjoy sex, or portray a sexy woman as inherently fetishistic. There are attractive women in real life, and while they overwhelmingly don't like being constantly oggled and sexualized, they do exist and we need to accept their bodies non-sexually. There is a problem in fantasy and especially games of presenting women as universally sexy, but I don't think the solution is to remove all sexy women. I don't want the lesson we teach busty girls to be that their bodies are fit only for fetishization. Rather, we need to have representation of all body types, and media to treat women textually and subtextually as more than sex objects.

NB: this is not necessarily a pro-sniddies comment. It is simply in response to the idea that tits on a snake or lizard person are morally wrong. The idea that there must be a binary between no representation of women and women only as sex objects is the problematic thing which must be addressed.","Nothing you’ve said here is something I disagree with, this is the fuckable vs worthless I was referring to, that female characters *have* to be attractive as far as triple A games and Hollywood movies are concerned, which very few people seem to have picked up on. communicating is hard.

And taking issue with something an artist has done with their art isn’t an attempt at stopping them from taking creative liberties it’s people voicing their own opinion on it and if the artist had made so many people feel so strongly against it, it’s the fault of the artist.

You guys can have your own opinions but would you mind telling me what you disagree with",">You guys can have your own opinions but would you mind telling me what you disagree with

Sure, here's a breakdown:

* ""They would serve no purpose other than objectifying women."" - Sex appeal and objectification aren't the same thing.  You can put tits on a lizard person and it doesn't follow that you think women are objects.  I mean, why would it?
* ""and unless you only see women for their tities"" - I have to break in and object to this qualifier because the premise of it is just wrong.  You can enjoy characters with sex appeal while still respecting women in the real world.  Even if you find certain shapes and attributes attractive, it doesn't follow that attractiveness is a quality you require in order to respect someone.  And now for the rest of that sentence...
* ""then they aren’t necessary for making them identifiable as women"" - I mean, I think it's probably fair to say it's about sex appeal, although giving a lizard person a feminine shape would help someone who doesn't know much about lizards (which is most people) know that a particular lizard person is a lizard woman.
* ""And taking issue with something an artist has done with their art isn’t  an attempt at stopping them from taking creative liberties it’s people  voicing their own opinion on it and if the artist had made so many  people feel so strongly against it, it’s the fault of the artist."" - So the problem here is that the ""sex appeal means you're objectifying women you misogynist"" crowd is very wrong with their idea that having sex appeal means that sex appeal is the only think that you care about, and they also have a frankly disproportionate amount of representation in the fan media right now, to the point where other media folks (outside of fringe youtube personalities who manage to make a living on it specifically) are afraid to engage with them.  Does it matter if one rando is wrong on the internet?  No.  Does it matter if there are a whole bunch of randos who are wrong on the internet and they have too much influence?  Yes.
* ""if the artist had made so many people feel so strongly against it, it’s the fault of the artist"" - That sounds awfully victim-blamey to me.

My opinion is this:  I'm a mostly straight guy, but over the past few years I've come to terms with the fact that I'm at least a little bit into guys, and I've realized that if I feel the *same sort of attraction to depictions of sexy men and depictions of sexy women, that people only get nasty and judgy and tell me I'm a horrible person who is objectifying the blah blah whatever about being into sexy women*.  I mean, to quote this ridiculous meme, I like lookin at attractive shirtless men, and nobody has ever accused me of sorting men into 'fuckable' and 'worthless'.  Women are people.  Men are people.  Lay off of other people's fantasies.

I mean, that's the long and short of it.  It's a fantasy world.  Some people like gritty realism, and that's totally cool.  Some people like things to be a bit more fantastic and idealized, including the appearances of the people who inhabit the world, and that's *also fine*.  This entire ridiculous controversy is based on this idiotic idea that fictional boobs = objectification.

Dragons and lizard folk are reptiles. This means they are not mammals, and like most other non mammals they lay eggs. (Yes this is confirmed in 5e lore) Non mammal creatures do not have tits bc they do not lactate. Therefore they have no reason to develope boobs. Now you might say ""BuT mR cOmMuNiSt ThEy ArEnT lIkE oThEr RePtIlEs ThEy MaY  jUsT lOoK lIkE rEpTiLeS."" To that I say fine. Let's look at other egg laying mammals, or monotremes. These include platypus, which are infact mammals that lay eggs. And these mammals do infact lactate. However they still dont have big mommy milkers. They secrete the milk out of glands on their body like sweat and it gets slurped up by their young. And lizard folk and dragons can infact be monotremes, because some mammals (like the pangolins) have scales. So if that sounds hot to you, you are welcome for your new fetish. But lizard folk and dragons do *not* have big mommy milkers. 

Thank you.","Also, I believe that all of the reptilian races in 5e are actually warm-blooded. They still follow the same rules of nutrition as other humanoids.

IMHO chainmail is the bigger logistical problem. Chain isn’t an object, it’s a series of linked objects. The one link you cast the spell on will get hot as hell but, due to how heat transference works, each connecting link will be notably less hot until there are links on your back that just aren’t even registering any kind of temperature increase.

"The thing with the Dragonborn is that the origin of the design goes back to 3.5 when they were introduced as a playable race. In this game Dragonborn were not a naturally occurring race, but were formed through a ritual where a humanoid would encase themselves in an egg-like structure and dedicate themselves to Bahamut who would the  transform them into a reptilian appearance in order to aid in the war against Tiamat. Dragonborn were also not a viable race (meaning they couldn't reproduce other dragonborn) they were either rendered infertile by the ritual or any offspring they had were of the race they were originally born from.","Since then their lore has changed though. The ritual process of infusing a humanoid with draconic magic now creates a half-dragon, not a dragonborn. We have confirmation that dragonborn were created by the dragon god Io, as servants. After millennia of servitude groups of them worked to slip away from their captors and eventually small groups did just that. Scattering across many known and unknown realms to colonize and reproduce. Dragonborn would not have tits because there creators would find no pourpuse in such a choice of form.",dndmemes
"Fully agree with your assessment of Lizardfolk and Yuan-Ti pureblood, Dragonborn I would make an argument of them potentially being part-mammalian though this can come down to separate lore arguments on the origin of Dragonborn","It would also come down to a debate on what you would count a Dragon as, as they are both able to maintain thermoregulation in cold to freezing climates, or even in temperate climates with such an extreme size, but also reproduce via eggs.",dndmemes
"I'm much more of a fan of this type of discussion over reptile tits. Y'know, the one that discusses it in good nature with in game lore, and in-game or real life biology.

Male lizardfolk could have larger heads than females, and the females would have a longer trunks (I guess that would be their torso) than males, since those seem to be common trait of sexual dimorphism in lizards.

As for Lizardfolk, well, do whatever floats your boat there!","I was looking for this comment. They are also warm blooded. My personal headcanon was always that the dragons created them from humans which where also a slave race in their original realm. So breasts - at least while nursing - would make sense.

The biggest contention is the Dragonborn, which, in my personal opinion, if you had to choose between Dragonborn and Lizardfolk, I'd pick Dragonborn as the lizard with breasts. I tend to view Dragonborn closer to the human side of the mammal/reptile scale when compared to Lizardfolk, and Dragonborn are shaped by Dragons, which can shift between a Dragon and Human form, so I'd imagine that the resulting hybrid would be a mix of Dragon and Human qualities, where as Lizardfolk are simply hyper evolved iguanas. 

With that argument, I think Kobolds should also lack breasts, as they are more lizard than man. Also a shortstack Kobold makes me feel uneasy.","100% none for the kobolds. No lore or biology reason for them. And agreed on being uncomfortable.

"I think harpies have actual lore that implies that they are elves from a cursed lineage.

>Long ago, an elf wandering a forest heard birdsong so pure and wholesome that she was moved to tears. Following the music, she came upon a clearing where stood a handsome elf youth who had also paused to hear the bird's song. This was Fenmarel Mestarine, a reclusive elf god. His divine presence stole her heart as he fled, vanishing into the woods as if he was never there. 

>Though the elf searched the woods and called for her stranger, she found no sign of his passage. Driven to despair by her longing, she begged the gods to help her. Aerdrie Faenya, elf goddess of the sky, heard the elf's cries and was moved to her aid. She appeared as the bird whose song had entranced the outcast god, then taught that song of beauty and seduction to the elf.

>When her singing failed to draw Fenmarel Mestarine to her side, the elf cursed the gods, invoking a dreadful power and transforming her into the first harpy. The curse worked its magic on the elf's spirit as well as her body, turning her desire for love into a hunger for flesh, even as her beautiful song continued to draw creatures to her deadly embrace.

Yuan-ti Snitties-Can, and honestly should as they were originally a human race that developed snake powers and traits, but intend to blend in among humans for nefarious purposes

Dragonborn Dragitties-Can, but don't have to, as they have a number of origin's, the current main one for 5e being they were made by gods/dragons/dragon gods to have features of both humanoids and dragons, and thus depending on their creator could lean more towards one than the other. Could even have this be a major tribal difference between some groups (Chromatics made their dragonborn more dragonic out of pride, thus no tiddy, Metallics might have tiddy depending on how fond their creator is of humanoids, Silver and Steel Dragonborn definitely have the tiddy)

Lizardfolk Lizzitties-Can, but really shouldn't, as the god of Lizardfolk is extremely pragmatic and simple, to the point where his whole dogma is ""Survive"" and we've no reason or indication they have any past shared ancestor with mammalian humanoids, the Humanoid general form is just a good evolutionary point for most genus for tool use.

Mind Flayer Illithiddies-Can, but don't have to.

"I tried to weave in a backstory from the last campaign my players were in, where an elven prince had been turned into a deer for a thousand years until the players freed him as a side quest. And I had this entire dramatic scene planned where his brother, who had been ruling in his place (immortal elves in the feywild, not standard player race), thanked the party for bringing him home because nobody knew he was still alive.

I know this is true but I don't like it anyways,"I love it OwO. That's 6-8 breasts, on one humanoid, presumably a bit lower down given the anatomy of the mammals I'm referring too, so likely running down the lower chest and belly. Pretty awesome right?

interestingly, if you wanna get more into the details, the way most people interpret this is actually wrong. As, given how on most mammals, the hind breasts are typically more productive, and this would translate to the larger titties being on the stomach area or possibly lower, while the smaller ones might be more on the ribs or chest.

So like, even if the structure is different, that's still 6-8 titties. Hot AF

Though on this topic, I’m actually just getting started, reader beware beyond this point:

While Aarakocra and reptilian races won’t have breasts, or nipples (neither males nor females will have nipples), though they may have well-defined pectorals if they’re really strong, it’s definitely different.

However, if you wanna get real spicy and REAL ACCURATE, technically both birds and reptiles (meaning dragons too potentially. Just note, I don’t advise going this realistic) they won’t have vaginas either. Birds and reptiles do basically all their business, IE waste, reproduction, out of a single hole known as the cloaca.

So if you wanted to get really technical, the only sex you’d ever be having with a non-mammal is a weird thing sorta like butt sex but also different and completely self-lubricating.

Isn’t nature wonderful?

Oh I just thought of some more. Even spicier and I don’t recommend this but for crazy accuracy, Frog and fish races (grung, locatha, etc) won’t have vaginal or cloacal sex at all, instead they’d lay their eggs and you’d jizz all over their eggs, given that’s how they reproduce IRL.

So one could just imagine a breastless she-frog getting off to a human or elf jerking off into the eggs she laid in a pond. I’m sure her sensitive skin might also have some potential, perhaps immersing herself into the water would allow her to chemically sense the things guys excrete when they’re doing it.

And this is just thinking about vanilla straight sex, once you start having male human on male beast race or female human on female beast race this leads to even more bizarre scenarios",dndmemes
"They’d have a ton of titles, sure, but they wouldn’t grow bulbous like human ones at all unless they were pregnant and/or actively nursing","Not necessarily, you have to think about equivalency. Humans are effectively the “beast race” equivalent of similar apes and, generally speaking, primates.

None of those creatures have “titties” and if humans are the natural translation of them and do have bulbous structures, then it stands to reason other mammalian beast races would too.",dndmemes

"Having been obsessed with mermaids in my youth I actually came up with an answer to this years ago. Here's the TLDR edition:

Considering that their swimming patterns mirror dolphins and whales both of which are mammals it's more likely that mermaids are mammals as well rather than half fish as we have been lead to believe.

Furthermore as dolphins are fully capable of producing milk it is not unreasonable to assume that mermaids would have a similar capacity and would therefore not be outside the realm of possibility to have fully functional mammary glands in the same manner female humans do.

In fact as waterborne mammals have an evolutionary advantage to have more fat reserves than their land based counterparts in order to prevent loss of body heat through the water they're immersed in it is not only possible but in fact probable that the average mermaid will have far more prominent mammary glands than the average human female.","!!! oh my god this is a great answer! I love mermaids as well!

I think I read somewhere that humans could have evolved to be aquatic but didn't, but we still retained some aquatic traits like inches of webbing between our fingers, and breasts as means of feeding our young while afloat on our backs. it'd be interesting to think of merfolk as humans who went fully aquatic",dndmemes
Have you ever had merfolk caviar?,*scribbles down idea for local town's delicacy*,dndmemes
"Live birth and nursing are correlated, but not actually really linked, but the question is a curious one. The evolutionary biology of mermaids is shrouded in mystery, so it is hard to say if they are humanoids who evolved fish-like features of fish who evolved humanoid features, however I am inclined to suspect the former. Their internal organs are pretty much all in the human half of the body, and are markedly more terrestrial in nature (e.g. I assume merfolk have a four chambered heart, they definitely have lungs, diaphragms, and vocal chords like tetrapods), so the phylogenetic tree of maximum parsimony involves merfolk evolving fron terrestrial humanoids. Also note, their tails have flukes like a cetacean, along the coronal plane, rather than being arranged on the sagittal plane like a fish's tail, another signifier of a tail evolved from legs. I would expect Merfolk to therefore function like other marine mammals, so they would most likely give birth to live young and nurse their young. Therefore mermaids do have titties.","Oh shit, I missed the cursed answers only caveat...

As with most conflicts in D&D communication is key. No-one at the table should be uncomfortable.     
    
I don't really think this is about tiddies on a snake, but sexualisation in general. If you and your party want to play a campaign filled with tiddies and ass, that should be just as fine as playing a political correct campaign.    
    
The thing I see more and more is a polarisation on how we are supposed to play. The whole goal of D&D is to have a good time, not bikkering over tiddies. Or, orks being evil, or whatever political point you want to make.    
     
We try to can drive out all things that offend us, make all races equal, remove all objectable topics. But where is the fun in that? And surely where is the lesson in that? Having political laden topics as slavery and over sexualisation helps us remind ourselves why it's bad.

"Inside the chest is the deformed undeveloped horse head squished against under-developed human organs. Inside the barrel of the horse is the undeveloped legs of the human. A giant parasitic centipede grafts itself on the spine of the two forming the connection and manipulating the two halves with electrical current. 

Centaurs are created when one of these centipedes infests the womb of a horse or human. The first time, the centipede will usually infest the human woman and is expelled naturally, unnoticed by the host. But not before collecting her eggs, or sometimes the entire ovary. Then the centipede will find its second host, usually the horse, and infest the womb.

The centepede then excretes a venom that resembles semen and ""fertilizes"" the human and horse eggs within its own specially grown ambiotic sack.

The fetuses will eventually grow around the centipede as it directly guides the development. Most of the time the host horse will die before the fetus is to term. The centipede will draw nutrients from the corpse of the host animal and continue development, growing on pace with the fetuses.

The centipede venom changes dna, and mutates the human and horse body to physically mature much faster.

The complete adult 'cent'aur will burst from the rotting corpse of the horse and devour the last of it for its first meal. The head of the centipede extends all the way up and down the spine, manipulating both brains and the centipede defecates through the horse anus.

It eats by protruding its mandables  through the soft pallet and into the mouth.

>The ancestors of modern mammals are thought to have laid the sort of porous, parchment-shelled eggs seen today among lizards, snakes and a couple of weird, monotreme mammals like the platypus. In contrast to the hard-shelled calcified eggs of birds, parchment eggs are at chronic risk of drying out, which means modern snakes and lizards often are constrained by the need to lay their eggs in a relatively damp setting.  
>  
>These ancient species stumbled on a liberating solution: Make yourself into a watering can, and you can lay your eggs wherever you want.

>""The likely first function of milk was to hydrate parchment-shelled eggs laid on dry ground,"" said Amy Skibiel of the University of Idaho, an expert in mammalian lactation. By this scenario, pre-mammals dribbled fluid onto their eggs through pores on their chest.

>Parchment eggs also are at risk of microbial infiltration, and genetic studies suggest that the earliest egg hydration solutions were fortified with anti-pathogen components.

After level 6 there's no way a monk is taking out a pally I'm sorry.,"Way of Mercy Monks- “That’s some sweet buttery disadvantage on checks and attacks right there...”

To be fair you need to get ahold of the unarmed fighting style to not look like an idiot and resemble a fighter’s action surge. But ever turn spent casting lay on hands is a turn not spent smiting you into oblivion. 

Way of the Open Hand could get some mileage out of forcing a paladin to make Dex and str saves with each FoB if they don’t get a stunlock off but without actually setting up to be ready for a throwdown (Like the unarmed fighting style or a decent Dedicated Weapon) in a white room the Paladin smokes a monk 8/10 times.

It should be something you have to go looking for, not something that's crammed down your throat by default if you want to exist near the space of these genres.

"What's the deal with all these snake tiddies memes?

I'm not complaining of course, just confused","To my understanding, 1 person made a meme about how artists should ignore people who say stop putting tits on reptiles because it's biological nonsense and then the day after someone else made a meme in reply stating that putting tits on reptiles isn't just a biological issue but also perpetuates the trend of oversexualising females in fantasy and thus the rivalry was born",dndmemes
"See this is an example of not being lazy.

It’s also fun to play with tropes and depictions in general.

In my setting for instance elves have a far more alien moral sentiment that I mostly straight up cribbed from Changeling the Lost and the Roads/Paths of Morality in VtM:Dark Ages. They’re definitely non-human in their attitudes and their entirely reality is shaped by being refugees from the Fae Wild. (Mechanically the way this plays out is that elven subtypes are less a product of ethnicity than to the courts one has pledged themselves to, thus it’s entirely possible for a High Elf to become a Drow or vice versa).

I get rid of Half-Orcs and just use Orcs (player characters use the same stat block for half orcs, sort of), but I make them more sexually dimorphic: Female orcs are much bigger and stronger than male orcs.

Goblins are deeply religious and believe in reincarnation because they frequently have litters of twins, triplets, and quadruplets, and have partial genetic memory, and selective genetic specializations. (Thus every goblin knows several Bob’s that have extremely similar personalities and tend like the same things and go into the same professions, likewise Sarah’s or whatever.)


Someone recently posted their version of dwarves in another dnd related thread that I loved so much I’m stealing it: Dwarven parents literally spend ages and money carving their children out of rock and gems and then bestowing them with life.

Like lizard-tits/snake-tits is just lazy (I’ll give the Yuan-ti a pass actually lore wise, but lizardfolk and dragborn don’t really have good explanations).",">(I'll give the Yuan-ti a pass actually lore wise, but lizardfolk and dragborn don’t really have good explanations).

"I did it with Chrono Trigger in mind. After introductions they get to attend a festival with different 'games' centred around various checks and saving throws to get their feet wet with rolling dice and trying things out. 
Arm wrestling for Strength Checks,
Pig herding for animal handling
Drinking contest for Constitution Saves,
And so on.

 The festival includes a massive pillow fight in a barn with children, watched over by an old lady knitting. The party can engage in it as a sort of 'no rules', pvp and no concequences introduction to how combat works. The funniest part being that the moment a pillow accidently hits the old lady she stands up and shows off that she's actually a Barbarian and the 'boss' of the encounter.

"Min/maxing is fun. Its part of defining the character. What are they good in OK in and terrible in? I played a Paladin with max CHA and like no INT or WIS. I remember a starting session in our home tavern, DMs asking us what were doing. Out of wierd reflex and not thinking I say Im in the library (double checks my stats for this new character I created last week) looking at all the pretty pictures.","The problem with the stereotypical min-maxer comes when they fail to read the table and devolve D&D to a war game. But neither of those problems are ultimately rooted in the stats of the character. Instead, they're about the player's attitude.

I've got a very powerful character running right now, but it's OK because he doesn't disrupt other players' enjoyment of the game. He is a bit of a munchkin, but he also meshes very well with the party, has good RP and story, and leaves room for others to excel.

"A reptile having mammaries doesn't make sense, biologically speaking.

Buuuuut, if the anthropomorphic snake or lizard lady were to give live birth instead of laying eggs, then it would make sense for them to have breasts, especially if their young does not emerge fully developed, like mammals, especially humans.

However, I have more than 2 hours on the game, and for that reason the request was denied. I thought the 2 hour limit only applied to games that you wanted to fully return. Was this an error and could I still receive back the difference between what I paid for the game originally and how much it went on sale for, or can you not partially return games that go on sale if you have more than two hours played?

If this was a mistake, I think it's due to how I actually bought Blackwake together with Arma 3, fully returned Arma 3, and now because I'm partially returning this game, the system maybe thinks that I was trying to complete a full return? (I selected the partial return option on the form as well as ""it is selling for cheaper now"", I never asked for a full return as I am enjoying Blackwake)","Steam does not do partial refunds. You can only refund a game if you are BOTH

2) less than 2 weeks since purchase",Steam
"How do i stop Steam link from changing my headphones and microphone to the ""steam streaming"" ones in the windows settings? I use a software which freaks out if these settings change, and it makes a big fuss whenever I use Steam Link","Given how windows works, it has to do that inorder to intercept the audio/mic from your system and instead ouput it ot the steam link. Games output their audio to the system default. Thats why steam changes the system default so that the audio goes to your link .

If you prevent that, then functionally you wont get any audio or mic usage on the link side since all your audio woudl only be available locally",Steam

it may be a bad game, but people should at least review it based on its own merits instead of just downloading it to leave a bad review and uninstall it before you even play it.",Steam

I forgot that this game existed lmao,I only know it still exists because of when people were streaming illegal movies and gachi on the Artifact section on twitch,Steam
"Still more than Anthem right now and more than Lawbreakers or Radical Hights ever had lmao

In my honest opinion, the biggest issue with Artifact was that its a paid PVP game with on top extra monetization with generic artstyle in a sea of already years old existing free to play PVP card games with big playerbase. Like who with their years time and money spend on unlocking stuff in Runeterra or Heartstone or Magic or whatever would try out to stay for longer in Artifact a game with controversial launch and not so good road map?

I appreciate that Valve tried something new but not only they made Artifact way too late but also didn't tried much to make it standing out amongst the others.

I really wish that Valve didnt tried to make PVP card game and instead tried something more original like singleplayer card game with optional coop in PVE form for a decent prize with good artstyle story and maybe even using their franchises with it like Half Life, L4D or Portal (kinda like Teppen but not PVP). At least that would last for longer and wouldn't need resources and staff to keep it alive for next couple of years.

I am glad actually that Valve is not like EA at least in this case. Anthem was over hyped for 7 years, released as a gaming biggest lie, then delayed promised fixes and rework by even mockingly calling it Anthem Next (like No Mans Sky Next) and now abandoned.

At the end No Mans Sky despite rough launch it delivered 2 years later and even more.

With Anthem, Bioware and EA didn't even tried.

Valve said ""here is a card game lol"" and just released it. Not much hype, low playerbase (because Valve fans didnt want that and the game itself wasnt really unique or interesting), obvious shut down months later.

Yeah they promised rework but I doubt even Valve knew what to do with the game so I am fine with them shutting it down that early.

I hope they will use that experience and work out on something else, something better now that is not a PVP oriented. Card game or not, I don't mind. Just a normal video game. No absurd monetization or free to play bullshit.

And hey - at least Valve didn't shut down servers instantly in less than a month like some certain people would do while insulting own playerbase for not understanding what a good game is.

Yes, I am looking at you, CliffyB.","200% agreed with you. I’m just glad both games are open and F2P now, so more people can try them out and enjoy the games themselves, and safely ignore the bullshit monetization and failed launch",Steam

"unpopular opinion i guess, but that's valid criticism. i'm neurodivergent and susceptible to addiction. i hyperfocus a lot in games and can forget to eat and sleep. it's just how my brain works. i pace myself and have coping mechanisms and stuff, so i'd find this review helpful so i can decide whether or not it's not worth the risk","But the point isn't really whether it's helpful. I agree that the comment itself is. The point is whether it deserves a negative review for that reason.

I have a Russian friend and we were just talking about game prices there. He said that piracy was huge there and only (relatively) recently people started buying more due to more reasonable prices.

I think publishers become too rich and forget how much copies they sell in Russia and CIS before Steam introduced regional pricing.,Confederacy of Independent Systems? 🤔,Steam
Dick move from spike right here. Funny how they think that only VPN users buy from these regions and forget that there are real people living there wanting to play their games,"oh yeah. as a turkish man, it's a massive hit or miss when it comes to game pricing. let's say for example, [a game like rimworld is about 60 liras](https://gyazo.com/b7d00f823e18aaf275c5296c7b3d62a0). not super affordable, but good enough with sales. payday 2 is [near 20 and even went down to free once, really](https://gyazo.com/3e1d12b0a8cb0337dad1d5301232c553) good. but for something like far cry 5, [it starts from 270 liras](https://gyazo.com/347bde53560003c6c965472fbf4ecb5e) for the standard edition and [even goes up to 540 for deluxe editions](https://gyazo.com/5ca6b8edcba6ad64dcdef6073bb6c843).

so MANY games just conver usd to lira and put that as[ the price with no adjustments to it](https://gyazo.com/fbadc9545f5501f334143d5b31f47527). I'm not gonna buy a game when it costs as much as my rent, will I? not even a joke, a 2+1 apartment's rent is about 400-700 a month depending on a lot of things. though thankfully, not all is bad. indie developers seem to be much more understanding about regional pricing so I've managed to gather quite a large visual novel collection. the rest, I pirate.

Sounds like they're tired of VPN fraudsters.,"Nah steam tackles this. They are raising their price due to greed.

VPN users won't care because they'll just move away or pirate.

Second let's assume for argument's sake it is just about the price and we ""wait for a sale"".

Previously a game was $200, 50% off so now it's $100. Cool.   
Now same game is $1.000, 50% off (same sale) and now it's $500.

It's over double previous full price even on a sale without warning whatsoever, and this is on ideal conditions and on the low end, some games went almost 10 times the price, from what I saw most were 6-8.   
PLUS there's a ton of other games in Steam - way too much competition. Very few people on their right mind will buy some products when they can get 5-6 other great games with that, and I'm a DR fan.

This is just beyond ridiculous and basically exiting the market entirely in those regions.",Steam
"Makes sense to me. It's a far better game. 

Don't get me wrong. Doom: Eternal had some really great ideas and was still fun.

Here's the mod tools."" the better.","As someone who enjoys the type of games Danganropa are, I wouldn't pay 40 bucks for it, and I for sure wouldn't pay over 60 bucks for a VN. Even the VN I love the most, Katawa Shoujo, I would struggle on deciding to pay 30 bucks for it. And that's a game that I have a tattoo of.

There is no reason to raise the price of a 3 year old game, by almost a third of the original price. That's insane, it would make more sense to make the newer game (if there is one) 60+ bucks",Steam

Yeah well they fucked themselves over with that ridiculous monetization system. I mean... Gabe's company has enough money to fill a vault with money like the one Scrooge McDuck had and they still thought that people will fucking LOVE paying for each card. Lowkey glad that Valve got slapped in the face with Artifact's utter failure,"Is your thought process here that once a company makes a decent amount of money they should stop earning money entirely?

"If this goes the way of Hades, Noita, Dead Cells, Stardew, etc, I’d love it. Consistent small updates with community understanding and feedback, slowly making a good game into a great one.",On the early access page they say the game is 50% content complete.,Steam
"Man, this is crazy. Good on these guys. It's nice to see so many good Indies lately. I think devs should start to realize that the lower buying point is very enticing and is still very profitable without being a F2P game and scaring off MTX weary people.","I've been traumatized by Ark: Survival Evolved. Far too many games see massive success in Early Access only to be completely abandoned. The Ark devs have consistently added new content and are now working on Ark: 2, and there are STILL gamebreaking bugs in the game that ruin the ability to play on official servers that have been present since day 1 of early access. It's a fucking shame. I'd like to play this game, but I just can't bring myself to take the risk of early access again.",Steam
"I'm playing it and I'm not sure why it appeals to that many people. Bought it because it looked nice but also because I was curious about the fad. 
TBH I'm not even sure I could put my finger on why I'm enjoying the game as much as I am. Usually I'm done really quick with survival games, but this one just works.","Yeah, it's tricky to tell what makes one sandbox survival game satisfying and another shallow. The leveling system is definitely pretty rewarding, maybe a bit addictive. The hunting is pretty fun, and the game overall feels pretty fluid and smooth. Having concrete objectives and points to works towards help too. Kinda reminds me of Terraria in some ways, with the boss fights.",Steam
"Valheim is a solid survival game. Building is interesting, combat isn't super easy which feels nice, and exploration is both terrifying and exciting. If you haven't tried it and are looking for a fun survival game to play with people then I highly recommend it.

"Damn that's like $70,000,000 in profit (valve takes around 30% I believe).  That's enough money to fund a few new games in addition to making Valheim even greater.  Or just take the golden parachute and run lol.","There's variation in regional pricing so the actual number is probably smaller, but still a significant chunk of change.",Steam
"As someone who could never get into any other survival/ building game, I can say this game has captivated me.

It has pretty much everything and it has sort of objectives.

Just stay true @devs. There area lot of companies like (Activision) Blizzard that got corrupted by the smell of tendies,Those damn chicken tendies man...,Steam
"I love the game in general, but it still falls into the same time-consuming grind trap. Mining enough ore takes forever and the distances you need to cover only get longer.

Some of the combat is downright annoying as you are supposed to use consumables to mitigate certain effects, forcing you into adopting a cook/buffer playstyle that I and Im sure many others just dont enjoy. Nothing is more boring than a ""click this to get stronger for 10 minutes"" buff","Covering distances is mitigated by building remote bases (if you don't like building then you are probably playing the wrong game) which can be done quickly with ruins then teleport or sail between bases.  If you are running long distances to do anything but exploring the interior of a continent or large island, then yeah its gonna be a slog.",Steam

"Sorry but refunds are not for trying out the games. You should know if you'll like the game or not before buying. Refunds are there for technical issues and 2h is enough for that. There were games i stopped playing after 50h because i decided i don't like them and they suck.

So do research before buying, listen to your friends, reviewers (the more the better).","Not really... refunds are for trying out a game and not only for technical issues. You can refund a game for any reason at all. I refunded most games with the reason ""its not fun"". The game worked fine but I knew after 1 hr of playing that this game is not for me. And I am probably not the only one.

I mean.. you mostly have to try out the game by yourself. How else are you going to know if the game is good or not? Reviews? Which one? The ones from those Review Journalists who give out 8/10 and 10/10 to every publisher game. Lets not forget that Cyberpunk got 8,9 and even 10.

You have to figure it out by yourself by playing the game for a bit. 

And your technical issue theory is also wrong. There are games which constantly crash after 2,3, 20 hrs. Not only that but some older games still have gamebreaking bugs which wont let you get further in the story.",Steam

My #1 tip for avoiding being scammed is to be careful if you see any red flags and check everything. For example if you're usually logged into Steam in your browser, but when you go to ""sign in with Steam"" on the external site and get prompted for Steam login instead of already being logged in, open a new tab directly to steampowered.com and check to see if you really need to log back in.

"First, if there is a known major sale that's date has been leaked, it'll be listed on https://steamdb.info/sales/history/  
  
Secondly, I know what you are asking, but I feel compelled to share this answer:  THERE IS ALWAYS A SALE.  
  
^^Note: ^^All ^^Times ^^are ^^PST/PDT  
**Daily Deals**.  - Start every day at 10AM . The item put on sale usually is on sale for 48 hours.  
**Weeklong Deals**.  - Starts Monday at 10AM , usually goes through Friday at 10AM.  
**Midweek Madness**. - Starts Tuesdays at 10AM ending Thursday at 10AM.  
**Weekend Deals**.  - Starts Thursday at 10AM , usually goes through Monday 10 AM.  
**Free Weekends**.  - Deal times are same as Weekend Deals, the game you can play for free usually stops being free Sunday afternoon even though the deal is usually good through Monday at 10AM.  
**Publisher week/weekends**.  - Dates/days vary and aren't known ahead of time.  
**Anniversary Sales**.  - Dates/days vary and aren't known ahead of time.  
**Event Sales** (Quakecon, May the 4th/StarWars, Anime weekend, shoot-em up sale, Golden Week, others I can't remember that they do randomly throughout the year).  - Dates/days vary and aren't known ahead of time.  
  
Then there are the major sales, exact dates aren't known/100% certain until the information leaks 1-2 weeks before they start...if they leak at all.  They will all start at 10AM on whatever day:  
**Lunar Sale** (Late January/Early February?)  
**Spring Cleaning Event** (Starts like a month or so before the Summer Sale, not really a sale as more of just an event to play your backlog)  
**Summer Sale** (Starts mid/late June)  
**Winter Sale** (Starts mid/late December)  
**Halloween Sale** (Around Halloween every year)  
**Autumn Sale** (Around US Thanksgiving weekend)  
  
AND THEN ON TOP OF ALL THAT:  Publisher/developers can put their game(s) on sale whenever they damn well feel like.  Released new DLC?  Make the entire franchise on sale!  It's the 12th of the month? 12% off all our games!  etc and so forth.  - These can vary on both date/time as a publisher can choose to end a sale at midnight if they felt like doing so. 
  
So, summary: **THERE IS ALWAYS A SALE!**  
  
Side notes:  
There are also lots of other retailers like Humble, Fanatical, etc that have their own set of sales which include games you can activate on Steam!  
Use sites like [isthereanydeal.com](https://isthereanydeal.com/) to see price history and lowest prices across multiple stores on games you want!  
Also don't forget to add games to your Steam Wishlist so you get notified when they are on sale!",it's nice you still post this.. it should be a sticky,Steam

"The hardware survey is a sampling from random Steam Users.  
Not everyone gets to participate in it.  
Not everyone who gets the chance to participate in it does.  
Video Cards have been a bit on the hard to find/overpriced the past bit, especially the 3000 series cards.  
  
Therefore my conclusion, and answer to your question is thus:  Of those selected to participate in the hardware survey, and did choose to participate, none of them owned a 3070.","Gotta disagree - i am an owner of a RTX 3070 (dual OC) and participated in the survey.

It still is not shown in the survey sadly. I think it is some sort of bug that it is not shown. When finishing the survey however it clearly stated in the Steam window that my GPU is the RTX 3070 and Steam clearly detected it.

Most other RTX cards are shown normally however. Maybe they fix it, or hopefully next month atleast.

I used to play TF2 every single day after school for years on end.

Since 2007.","I wasn't there. I was late to the party, by a lot. First time I played was in 2016, and even then I only started playing a lot not too long ago, I've only \~300 hours in the game. But I wish I had been there earlier. I wish I had played more even then. Tf2 is an amazing game, and the fact that every round I've played as of late has eventually been overrun with bots is painful. 

Valve thinks they killed the game with jungle inferno, they don't want to make more updates, fine, whatever, spy could use a little bit of a playstyle shakeup, sniper needs some attention, but whatever. But you won't even keep the servers secure? TRY to stop the bots? 

It's really painful for me, personally. I may not be the person who should be complaining the most, I'm not good whatsoever, I don't play a lot, I've never even queued for competitive, I'm just NOW learning how half the game mechanics work, but it's still painful for such a good game to be so close to beginning a downward spiral towards death.

Not to mention how cool the economy is and how many games should have similar mechanics IMO. I'm just praying maybe valve will see the mistake they've made. Even if they don't make any more major content updates, just adding some new community-made weapons or maps on occasion, making sure the game is still...y'know. Playable.

Tf2, CSS, Garry's mod where my jam. But TF2, something clicked. Within those years of high school, I logged just about 700 hours of play. Not as hardcore as others, but considering being busy with classes and playing other games, it was a lot for me.

I always played the spy, became the spy player of my friend group. Probably a good bit of 500 hours just playing spy. Such good times! Fun times, memorable times, unforgettable times. 

I've lost touch with my old friend group after high school. We went our separate ways since now we had to focus on our careers and futures. I still clung on with mvm, then I stopped. Stopped playing tf2, css, gmod, and other source games. After that moved into other games. They never were ever to scratch that itch of mine from years past, but they were still fun either way.

When I look at my friends list, I see those familiar names of my old friends. And of course, most of them are ""last online x years ago"", with a couple still playing some games today. I look at them and just remember the good times we had. I wonder what they're all up to today.

This time of steam's life was magical, it made my high school career perfect, magical, unforgettable. Nowadays it's past. It's not the same with pc gaming somewhat as mess with 10 different games launchers and store fronts, and the return of awful console to pc ports compared to the early to mid 2010s. If only we could go back to those early days, with community server browsers and custom maps, skins, sprays, etc... The things that made tf2, css fun instead of focusing hardcore on competitive and matchmaking. I miss the community aspect of these games. Everyone talking on mics and chatting, having fun.

Buying from cheaper countries is very widespread. Valve did nothing to stop it so far but it's against the rules. So whenever valve decides to stop this they can ban you.,"that's not true at all- i mean, that they've done nothing to stop it. if they find you're lying about location, they can and will give you a payment ban.

for instance, recently, someone posted about being banned for the next 13 years on here. it was found that he was living in iraq, but had his location set elsewhere, because valve doesn't run in iraq/doesn't support their currency. valve found that out and gave him a ban.",Steam

"I get what you are saying.  
But storage isn't free.  Bandwidth isn't free.  It may not be something Valve is wanting to spend extra money on.  
I'll take the wild example of 32MB on TOP of the 8MB you already get.  
If only 1 million (of the over 100 million existing) Steam Profiles take advantage of that, it's an extra 32TB's Valve would need in storage.  But that's not including the overhead that most enterprise storage systems are using some form of RAID or other thing.  Plus they probably do some form of backup (which requires it's own storage) along with replication to various places on the internet to make loading of that data faster...so that initial 32TB's could end up being hundreds of TB's of extra storage.  
Plus they'd want to have free space on top of that in case some popular youtuber put out a video on how to make these super huge artworks and there was a sudden influx of people uploading their large artworks.  
Then of course the extra bandwidth to display these pages that will be visited dozens to hundreds of times a month (depending on the user obviously).  
  
Like I get your point, and I'm not meaning to shit on it.  Just saying when you are as large as Valve, a small change like increasing available file size is not as simple as just adding another hard drive to one server.  
  
Either way, have you tried Garfield Kart?  That shit is crazy!","I get that but 8mb is literally barely enough nowadays. They make their backgrounds 10s long with 600-2000 different colors and their shades and I somehow have to make a 10s long gif that looks acceptable/good with 128 colors, loss and what not. Even changing the size limit to 10mb would be such a huge improvement and let's be real, not many give enough shits to make fancy profile artworks.

What can show under Yellow: Game key revoke, Beta access revoke, VAC ban, Overwatch / Game Ban, and I think there there on more.

What can show under Red: Account lock this can happen by owner locking account, or Steam support believe the account was hijacked doing scams basically. Account Ban from community usage either temp, or perm depending on the issue at hand. Account trading ban which is permanent.

Red basically the worse alert, as either account becomes limited temporary until the issue resolved, revoking certain things the person can do on Steam service but can still have access to the games on the account, or the person intentionally did something so bad that got support to take action, and try to test their limits to getting account permanently limited, or locked for good.

I have been disappointed with steam remote play. I have tried to use it twice. Once I was sent a connection for A Way Out and had terrible audio issues. The second time I sent a link for PGA 2k21 and we have never been able to get past the splash screen. We have done our fair share of googling and tweaked both our routers / steam settings. It just doesn't work as advertised.,"You've got to be more specific than that. What does ""tweaked both routers"" mean? What specs are we talking about from the source PC? What about the receiving PC?",Steam
"I just wish they added a feature that was the OPPOSITE of this. As in, if you have multiple screens and the game has online multiplayer you can flick a switch and you and a mate can play the game on two separate screens. It'd be amazing, becuase the amount of split screen games is stupidly limiting on PC.","That mainly has to be supported or developed by the game developer, not Valve, and I don't think we will see that in foreseeable future.",Steam

No it shouldn't. The way it currently is is much better. Stop being lazy it's literally a 1 click difference.,"What's the current way? You mean clicking right clicking the game and doing it that way?

What were the risks involved while developing the game? Anything you feared initially but it all turned out to be well?,"It wasn't particularly risky for me, thankfully. I've been able to develop in my spare time, and there wasn't really any big upfront investments that would need to be paid off- using an open-source engine and creating all my own assets is great for that, haha.

Initially, I only planned to make a small game for myself, so in some ways just getting it out commercially is more than I expected at all! I think my biggest fear is game-breaking bugs that I don't find. There have been a couple, but they've affected only a tiny tiny percentage of folks playing the game, and at least I've been able to help people edit their save files to get them fixed haha",Steam
Do you have a favorite Zelda game? Mine is Link Between Worlds.,"I think at the moment, it's a toss up between Oracle of Seasons and Breath of the Wild. Seasons was the first one I played, so it's got tons of nostalgia for me. Plus, manipulating the seasons is really cool, and I like how tightly the overworld is woven together. And running into Maple is really fun! Plus replaying it as a linked game is very neat.

Then Breath of the Wild is just an absolutely amazing experience when it comes to exploration and making small moment-to-moment discoveries fun, unique, and meaningful. I just wish Akkala was bigger, it's my favorite region!",Steam
How long did it take for you to finish and publish your game?,"So I started in early 2017 I think, and the game released January 21st- so about 4 years even! Of course, I'm still working on it to fix a few bugs that we didn't find in QA!",Steam
"So it's been... roughly about an hour since I think this started? This was supposed to start at 10am and go till 11, but the r/steam bots blocked me and I'm not sure exactly when the post actually went through.

Anyway, the moral of the story is that there's a code giveaway at the end! I guess, feel free to keep asking me any questions if you have some, but here's some codes for Ocean's Heart for Steam. I'm pretty sure this is how you give them out. First time doing something like this:  


AZ6BB-LDPD8-Z4H0P

CGKQ5-NTC7P-XV3HC

RJAPB-3YDR4-A0WQQ

QRCHG-Q0R92-YLZ45

FRBWX-69DLI-B4CFK","All the codes have been redeemed.

In the future you might want to obfuscate them a little like 

>AZ6B?-LDPD8-Z4H0P, missing letter is B

"The game looks very good. Did you take care of any things that might trigger Nintendo on taking any legal actions against this game, considering how they are? And what were those things if any in particular?","I mean, Nintendo takes action against fan games that use their IP. Ocean's Heart pays homage to Zelda in a lot of ways, but is its own game entirely, so I don't know what they'd have to take action about.",Steam
"How are you so creative with all these areas? 
Question: Does the game have any botw mechanics?","Haha, thanks! I try to focus on cool concepts for ideas or a central landmark, then stitch them all together into a world and fill in the gaps.

There's a light crafting system like BOTW has, and the world can be pretty open but it's not quite the ""go anywhere at any time"" situation.",Steam
"I know im late but i love these types of games, definitely gunna try it out!",Thanks so much! Have a good time! : ),Steam
When we can buy Ocean's Heart in the PlayStore from Google... ? The Store needs a good Zeldalike game! :P,"Haha, unfortunately the android port of Solarus is only in beta, and I don't think playing a massive ARPG on a phone is really the best platform for it anyway.",Steam
"I'm wanting to make a zelda-like too and have been looking at Solarus. How have you found working in it? Have you had experience in other platforms like unity/gadot? Better/worse for a newcomer?

Also I have to ask, it looks like portability of Solarus is pretty limited right now, is there any hope for Oceans Heart on consoles and how would you even be able to go about that given Solarus limited cross platform functionality?","I've absolutely loved working with Solarus because it is geared specifically toward zeldalikes. That and the community is so helpful and eager to share code, help, and ideas. I don't have experience with unity or gamemaker or godot, but from what I understand Solarus will likely let you get a zeldalike together quicker than those platforms, because it is more specialized.  


There are some downsides currently with Solarus- one I'm working to solve right now is that like SNES games, you can't move less than a pixel. So when you're working at resolutions like I am, this can create a bit of stutter in the camera when moving diagonally, since you can tell the different between moving 1-2px per frame and 3-4px. Also, like you said, it hasn't *yet* been ported to Switch or other consoles.

I don't have anything to report on console ports for the engine currently, but the engine devs are very interested in getting them together, and I don't think they *won't* happen, it's more a matter of *when*. I imagine within a year or two, Solarus will be at least ported to a console or two.",Steam
"You mentioned in a previous comment that you developed everything in the game, do you have an regrets or anything that you’d change if you had the chance? 

Also I just wanted to say that this game looks so cute and wonderful! It’s defs going on my wish list!!","Thanks so much!

I think in general, I would have liked to have put more branching sidequests with interesting choices to make. Also, the story maybe could have used a couple passes from someone more experienced in game writing, there's a couple clunky places. It also would have been cool to add in story sections that introduce unique gameplay mechanics that only happen once.

But at the end of the day, that would have added even more time to a 4-year development cycle, which is a bit long for a first game! I'm excited for the games I do next, because I've learned so much from Ocean's Heart and will be able to start fresh and build a better foundation for them : )",Steam
"Did you take inspiration from other Indie steam games you have played?

If yes, what ideas did you borrow/implement in your game?","Not Steam specifically. I prefer to play games on consoles- I didn't even have a Steam account until I needed on to test Ocean's Heart. For the first few days when Ocean's Heart was out, Steam wouldn't let me post in my own game's discussion boards because I hadn't spent $5 on games. I guess it's something to keep bots out, idk.  


But I do love indie games and play a lot on PS4 or Switch. Hollow Knight is a masterpiece, and its sprawling world and willingness to put secrets in VERY hidden places was super inspiring. I also loved Hyper Light Drifter's exploration, and its fun dodge mechanics and minimal storytelling were things I wanted to do as well, so it was great to see how it executed them so well.",Steam
"Looks like a neat game, what tools did you use to develop it?","So I use the Solarus Engine:  
[https://www.solarus-games.org/](https://www.solarus-games.org/)

It's free and open-source, and has a great community. It's pretty flexible for 2D games, but is most focused on making ARPGs like Zelda, so if that's what you want to make, it's really helpful. Also, the community is wonderful. Still pretty small, but the folks working on the engine and other games are super talented and very willing to share and help one another.",Steam
"in my mind if someone mentioned indie games, it's a pixel game and platformer since it's about the gameplay loop to make players keep playing.  
What is your gameloop formula to keep players keep playing your game?","What I wanted to focus on most was exploration. I guess the loop is that there is just a LOT to discover in this game's world. There's dozens of sidequests, tons of secret areas, and like 80% of the items are hidden optional ones. Lots of stuff is pretty tricky to discover too, so constantly rewarding the player for exploring off the main path was my strategy.",Steam
What have you learned after releasing the game and working on the first patch? And also what was the most challenging thing in developing the game?,"Since release, I've discovered that there are lots of people that STAUNCHLY prefer to play games with different input methods than me. Like, I prefer a controller, and a keyboard is fine if I must. But lots of people swear by keyboards and mice? I don't understand why you'd want to use a mouse for this kinda game, but that's something I'll take forward with me into my next game!  


The most challenging thing was probably working out the multitude of different types of controllers, or complex menus. I hate making menus!",Steam
"Now that Ocean's Heart is out, what are your future plans?","I'm really interested in bringing Ocean's Heart to consoles- especially Switch. We'll see about that soon I hope!

In the mean time, I'm working on some free code and graphic assets to help people make their own games! As far as next games, I've got a couple irons in the backburner, but don't have any solid plans yet : )",Steam
Hi! What are you more proud of about this game?,"This having been my first game, I think I'm most proud that as a solo developer who didn't even know how to code when I started, I was able to finish something of this magnitude. It might not really break the mold of zeldalikes, or have crazy new ideas, but it's done, it works, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!",Steam
"Hey there, how did you manage through 2020 with the whole Corona Crisis? Must've been tough for indie developers I imagine.","Luckily, my day job allowed me to work from home without any sort of changes to income or anything, so it didn't honestly affect Ocean's Heart a ton. If anything, I had more time to work on it since I couldn't hang out with my friends.",Steam
What was your favorite part of working on this game as a solo developer?,"I like that being a solo dev allows ultimate creative freedom. I think sometimes I can be a very harsh critic, and other times I get a very specific picture of how I want something to look/sound/feel. When I'm not satisfied with something that I made myself, I don't feel bad about absolutely trashing it and demanding that it be redone, haha.

There's definitely disadvantages too though, because I miss out on other people's visions and creative voices.",Steam
"Looks really cute. With the popularity of Stardew and it being developed by one person (I realize this is a very different game), what are some challenges you faced?","Well, not knowing how to code at the beginning was quite a challenge because I had to teach myself how to do the job I'd set out to do lolol  


Probably the other most challenging thing was controller integration. No end to problems there lol",Steam
"Is the game out, steam page not fully loading for me","Yes, says in the OP that it came out a month ago. January 21st, if you're looking for a specific date.",Steam
"Alot ARPG r on phone... or Tablet :) Ocean's Heart support Controller, so why not? :) or u have no Phone? Hehe :D","Solarus (the engine Max used for Ocean's Heart) on Android is currently in beta. Maybe in the short future, it'll be possible to play it on your phone.",Steam

">Apple's lawyer, Jay P. Srinivasan, says that the request is doable, and points out that Apple could have requested data on all 30,000 games on the Steam store, but that it instead is only requesting data on 436 games.

Well that's some bullshit.,"Nope, pretty standard practice in anti-trust suits. Also why Valve was very cooperative, they only filed for relief.",Steam
Can any legal minded people chime in? How can a judge order Steam to provide info when they're private? Can't Steam counter this or whatever? Doesn't seem fair at all.,"Quote from someone with more background info than me:  
> The amount of people who spoke about the American legal system without understanding a thing about it in the last thread about this was not shocking. It didn't help that the PC Gamer article was heavily editorialized and was also written by someone who's clearly never covered a single anti-trust lawsuit in their life.

> Apple's behavior here is bog fucking standard for anti-trust lawsuits.

> There was no ""fighting back"". Valve's response to Apple's inquiry was a standard legal response to get Apple to cover the cost of Valve putting in the manhours to drudge up the information that Apple wanted. That's all it was.

> There would be insane legal implications to Apple's lawyers handing any of this information over to Apple itself, and if even a SNIFF gets out, there's going to be a fucking hellacious lawsuit in response. For the folks hitting the conspiracy theory button.

> Valve does not give two shits about this. They just didn't want to pay for having to do it. Which was reasonable. They'd already handed over everything else Apple requested, from having read the legal docket, just not the shit related to them having to do some work to get it done.

> Epic is arguing that Apple, a digital storefront, is abusing their position to overcharge customers. Apple is using Steam, probably one of the biggest digital storefronts in the world, to go, ""This is normal.",Steam
Why do they need that info though?,"AFAIK court cases become public record so when it's all said and done, someone could go in and see how Apple's legal team uses this data in their arguments.

Until then they understandably don't want to spill the beans.",Steam
"Yeah, Valve will definitely appeal that, how the fuck could Apple think they can just demand someones data who isnt even part of the lawsuit?","They did appeal for relief. Valve doesn't care, they just requested that Apple pay for the time it takes for them to gather the data. Read dockets.",Steam
Valve needs to counter the order... this is ridiculous...,"Here's a good summary you should read: https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/ls5tav/valve_ordered_to_give_apple_information_on_436/goqa97o/

"I just hope steam uses this opportunity to publish the information of xxx games and bloatware that plagues the store just for the sake of it, since I assume the lawsuit doesn't specify which game's information should be given","If they narrowed it down to 436 games, odds are that number is not random and Apple has requested the information of those 436 games by some criteria. I doubt it’s up to valves discretion on which game data to provide.",Steam

I feel like it might be underutilized since a large amount of people have a card saved and just debit it,"This precisely.

While I understand a lot of us who play games aren't working stiffs like some of us, most are.

Meaning most of us aren't going to make even a portion of our checking account dedicated to Steam.

We want it? We buy it.

From a product managers perspective, this idea has a VERY low ROI as it is an edge case targeting a subset of their user base, who also happen to be on the lower tier of spending.

my steam wallet: . 37¢,probably enough for a hentai game,Steam

"Well I for example never actually have any money on my Steam Wallet and buy all the games with Paypal/Credit card.

No need to take the money out if it's going to be used anyway and not needed elsewhere. Not that you can easily take money out of your Steam wallet anyways.",Steam
"IMO, this was just a jab at Steam prices of video games. OP knows there’s filters like others have pointed out but OP is just unhappy with the prices of games.

"Not a dev myself, but those statistics indeed look very useful and it's a good reminder to consider using Steam Input API for maximum compatibility","Yeah it's easy to forget as most users won't notice how great the Steamworks dev backend is, which in turn gives great insight on how to release bigger and better games or improve them as desired.

"I don't know how Steam recognizes controllers,  but I personally use 3rd party software to make my PS4 controller ""disguised as"" a xbox controller.

"RemotePlayWhatever doesn't do anything but tell Steam to start a remote play session with a user for the thing it thinks you're playing. There shouldn't be any more problems with controllers or stream quality than using Steam to natively start the remote play session. 

Your issue is with remote play as a whole, I think. Play around with your streaming settings as a host, and have the client play around with theirs. Check your upload bandwidth is sufficient for the resolution/framerate/quality you're targeting.","Yeah I just fiddled around with my settings, hope something got fixed with it.  
Still it's always good to have alternatives.",Steam
You can start remote play then minimize the big picture and launch any program! If you go in controller configurations there should be an option for desktop configuration where you can setup your controller to work with your non steam games,OP's talking about Remote Play Together,Steam
You can install non-steam ganes and they'll show im yoir library and people can see you playing them in Steam.  It's been a thing for years.  I may have misunderstood you though.,Huh...I guess that’s what I was a getting at. I feel dumb now,Steam
"All games are tied to your Steam account so you'll be able to reinstall all of your games on your new PC.

All of your game data is stored on the cloud so you'll also have that after you switched.

Hope this helped :)","Do not assume your saves are all in the cloud.  Not every game supports cloud saving and some also have to be enabled in game even if they do support it.  Better to copy the save folders onto an external device to be able to move to the new pc rather then lose a save that you put many hours into.

Most saves files will be in the documents folder either in their own folders or in the my games folder.",Steam
Another question. Anyway to copy paste the game folders instead if re downloading the games. If i move the folders to the new drive but same location in the file structure will steam see them?,"You should be able to copy the folders over and steam will find them, when you click ""install"" it'll verify the files and do any updating necessary.  Game files are in the ""steamapps\\common"" folder.

A lot of games don't have cloud saves and you'll need to transfer those files from ""My Documents"" or wherever they saved.  That might take some googling.",Steam
You’ll have the files but won’t be able to play it after 3 days.,Thanks!,Steam

You can assign one of your controller buttons as a key using a third party driver such as Antimicro or JoyToKey. However that would make that button a key as long as the driver is active.

My unofficial review:  [I absolutely love it](http://hahahathud.com/cloud/feelsgood.jpg), but it is definitely not for everyone.  With Steams Big Picture Mode and the ability to customize every feature of the Steam Controller per game, you can do some amazing things with it.  It feels good in my somewhat large hands, the paddles on the back and dual function triggers work wonderful, just a great layout.  
  
That being said: The touch pads are not for everyone, sometimes  it would be nice to have a thumbstick/dpad instead.  The build quality isn't the greatest, it is plastic obviously, and on par with many other controllers.  
It really depends on what kind of games you plan to play, and how much you like tweaking your controls.  
If you are looking for just some casual gaming out the box with little tinkering, probably best to go with an XBOX/Playstation contoller as they work well too.","I really wanted to like this controller. The concept is great and I loved the right track pad. There are so many customization options and hidden features like gyroscopic controls. 
 
 I wish they made left thumb stick with a thinner neck since the travel distance is so small. The position of the thumbstick feels awkward and gives my hand cramps. I find the build quality on par with a cheaper third party controller rather than an official xbox controller. Pressing on the trackpad vibrates the entire controller and makes it feel hollow. The triggers don't have any dampeners and are loud when released. Overall, the controller is pretty noisy. 
 
 It is a great concept and I hope someone takes the controller idea and improves on it. The idea still has amazing potential.",Steam

I understand that survival/crafting games are not everyones cup of tea, but trust me when I say Valheim is quickly shaping up to be the epitome of the genre. The devs have somehow nailed every compelling gameplay loop found in similar games and brought them together into something that is consistently fun no matter what task you are working on. I have spent countless hours in Rust, 7 Days to Die, Citadel, Life is Fuedal, Minecraft etc etc. and this game does mostly the same things the others do but balanced perfectly.

Copy pasting my own comment. 



This is why i fucking hate Epic exclusives, the only game i care is AC, if they put that on Epic and uplay and not on Steam, i am done with ubisoft. 

for a millionth time

before you jump on my and say ""oh it's still on uplay so i dont know what's the big deal""

* Uplay doesn't offer regional pricing.

* Uplay doesn't accept debit cards from local countries in all of Asia

* Uplay doesn't offer refunds

* Uplay prices games in euros in Asia when it can list it in dollars but they won't. That means a 60$ game is priced 60€ in Asia (price of euros is expensive than dollars) and you'd be also paying full price in euros in Asia.

* [Their customer support took 3 years to unban me because my name has ""kum"" in it. You heard it right, they told ""kum"" is an offensive word. God help benedict cumbernauld](https://twitter.com/RohithkumarSP/status/1317388111064674305)

* I could go on and on about other stuff that uplay is missing but you get the gist of it.

* In Asia 80-100 dollars is most beginner's monthly basic salary. Now imagine when there's no regional pricing and expect you to pay 60 euros for a game and that too standard edition. Forget about the 90 euros deluxe editions

I don't mind uplay as long as I can buy it on steam when i can use Local Wallets and buy it with regional pricing.

Also, Ubisoft's Motto has always been 

1 step forward 3 steps back has always been Ubisoft's motto. 

* they do origins they added loot boxes which you can buy with in-game money, but ACOD they forced you to buy it with real money 

* they added alpha packs to R6 but they started adding exclusive themed alpha packs which you have to buy with real money and just can't buy the item you want

* [FC 3 was the last game to have multiple saves, FC4, FC5, FC Primal and new dawn their own support page says you have to delete the first game save file to start a new game. they even have instruction to copy the folder if you want your original save.](https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/8eubte/feature_request_please_bring_back_multiple_save/)

* DIvision 2, wildlands all of their online-only game has multiple save options but THEY DON'T support multiple save files in ACU, ACS, WD1, WD2, ACO.

* ACO has multiple save slots but you can never manually save to 2nd slot 

* They gain all the goodwill by making R6 but then get greedy and start to pull all games from Steam and put it on Epic store.

i can go on and on about all the shit UbiSoft has done since 2012

it is always 1 step forward 3 steps back with UbiSoft

"How bad do you guys abuse your controllers.. geez.  Been gaming for 30 years and have no issues.

Currently using Steam controllers, Logitech F710","It says right on the manufacturers website they fail at a certain point. Personally, I've never had a controller go drifty on me, usually the shoulder buttons shit out before that. I also haven't owned a console since Dreamcast. I just don't want to buy something for $50+ dollars that has a known fault and limited lifespan. The last of my wired xbox360 controllers both now have faulty cords (one was definitely thanks to a pupper). Hence why my roommates dualshocks are in the picture.",Steam
"Never had drift on a dual shock,
Both of mine have worked for 6 years without issue.","I really appreciate your super informative answer to my question!

""iFixIt’s teardown revealed that the DualSense analog sticks rely on the same Alps-manufactured joystick mechanism used in the DualShock 4, Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, and numerous Xbox One gamepads. The mechanism’s potentiometers have an expected lifespan of 2 million cycles. That sounds like a lot, but it’s not.

iFixIt explained:

“One of our teardown engineers measured their own Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) controller interactions for back-of-the-envelope joystick life math. Averaging ten different 30-second intervals, they made roughly 100 full potentiometer rotations per minute. If you play a less stick-intensive game than a first-person shooter, rotating 80 times per minute, you’ll hit 2,000,000 rotations in 25,000 minutes, or 417 hours—that’s just 209 days, playing 2 hours per day. At a more kinetic 120 rotations per minute, that’s 139 days at 2 hours per day. So Alps’ own rating for accurate joystick measurements is, in one gamer’s hypothetical experience, 4-7 months—and that’s with a very non-pandemic 2-hour cap on your game time.”

A company called CPI makes an optical sensor joystick that may answer a lot of the issues. Time to look into some hardware design, be the change and all that.",Steam

"Was the game made with python? If yes, then that's why. Python is an interpreter language. That means, it needs another piece of software, the interpreter, to read the code and execute it when you run it. As opposed to compiled languages, which need another piece of software called a compiler which transforms the code into machine code (i.e., processor istructions) so the program runs natively on the system and can be deatached from the compiler later.

This means that, to have a python exe that works, you need to do funky stuff. There's a program called PyInstaller which does this thing, how? It bundles the program along with the python interpreter. You can choose to do all this in a single executable file even! What's the problem? Well, that having all this functionality in a single executable triggers antivirus software, because that's a common pattern I guess. So, compiled python programs often trip these things, but you shouldn't pay attention to it.",Thank you!,Steam

PNG files thrown in the root of your Documents folder, not managed by Steam's screenshot manager, only sorted by having the appid in the filename. Could be a bit better, like actually putting them in the Steam screenshots folder.

PNGs aside, though, maybe having a little bit more the quality setting of 90 on those JPEG screenshots would be nice.",Steam
"Like it's already been mentioned, steam already has an option of saving an uncompressed copy and has had it since at *least* 2015 (I used it for a while back then before I realized it's just not worth the extra space they take). Turn that on and you're good to go, no point shoving .pngs down everyone's throats as the default when it makes one screenshot worth the size of 3-4 .jpgs","Trouble is, those TGA files tend to be up to 3 times the size of identical PNGs, and terrible quality JPGs are created along with of them, potentially in multiple directories.",Steam
"Although the higher quality of PNG is more desirable, I still default large screenshots to use JPEGs just because Internet upload speeds are destitute compared to download speeds; uploading a high-resolution JPEG is nearly instant, but uploading a high-resolution PNG usually takes a few seconds.

Can someone explain to me the difference? I just know that .jpg or .jpeg sometimes get blurry when you save them,"Steam's JPG encoding is terrible. the resulting JPGs are blurry, a lot of color info is destroyed and at the default 90-quality, covered in JPEG artifacts.

comparing the huge, uncompressed lossless TGAs to the resulting steam JPGs is shocking. manually converting to JPGs via gimp for example results in much better quality.

PNGs use lossless compression and are a faction the size of Steam's TGA files for the same quality.",Steam
100% agreed. jpeg has to die.,"It really doesn't though and honestly I feel like png will die far before jpeg does

The problem is although png looks better since it's lossless it takes up 10x the amount of room and most people don't really care about the bit of loss the experience when creating a jpeg file. People will however notice all the space their pictures will start taking up should you get rid of jpeg files",Steam

"This is what based people call, ""Showing your power level"". Basically it means, you don't hide your fetishes or kinks that any normal person would hide. For example, lets say you really love anime characters with skimpy armor. So you buy 2 or 3 figures of female characters, but all they show is a little cleavage and maybe some leg, but that's it. You are hiding your power level. If you weren't hiding your power level, the figures would be in sexual positions, have their clothes damages or have their skirt flying up so you can see their butt.

BUT

People who ""show their powerful"", like in every episode of Dragon Ball Z is STILL hiding their true power level. Meaning, even though they're showing more than the average person would. They're still hiding their deepest more shameful fetishes. So that dude with 200 sexual figures (not counting the dudes with 200 various and tame figures because figures are literally just like buying a painting or mini statues that moms like the buy), probably wants to get the figures of girls actually doing sex acts rather than just being in a sexual pose. Or they have horrible power levels and want to get stuff that would make even the most perverted of us cringe and gag.

At a local video game con back in like....2016 I want to say, there was this dude who looked maybe late 30's early 40's wearing a jacket with a very questionably young anime girl on the back completely naked with the private bits covered in, i think leaves or something. That guy was showing his power level. Me and my friends overheard him talking and he was apparently in the military. In his free time he liked collecting hentai and anime stuff. I think the guy was a little off. Maybe something happened while he was deployed.

But basically, anyone who shows a high power level typically has something more shameful they're hiding that they're not willing to ever reveal. Everyone has their secrets. Most straight guys will never admit they like Futanari (anime women with penis) porn, and the ones who are insecure about their sexuality will lash out and call people ""gay"" as if that's an insult and then try to break down why they think it's gay because they need people to feel as insecure as they do.

"The ask you to add them because they cannot send friend requests with their limited account (as you noted).  
You add them, they tell you some bullshit story about how they accidentally reported you and you need to talk to a Steam Admin.  
The 'Steam Admin' is fake and will show you fake things to try to convince you that your account will be banned if you don't do...something... make a purchase that'll be refunded, share purchase history screenshots...or to go log into a phishing site to take your account...something along those lines.  
  
There goal is to either get your account, or get money from you to prevent it from being banned.  Something like that (Honestly I'm going off the dozens of posts I've seen about it, so I'm not 100% certain as it seems different scammers have different goals).  
  
>And most importantly, why are they trying to scam me?  
  
The reason they are trying to scam you is simple:  They want whatever they can get from you.  
Your account: They can use it to spam your friends on Steam with various phishing links (Hey vote for me in this CS:GO tournament friend!).  
Also if your account is not limited, they can use it to send out friend requests to other potential victims.  
You could have Steam Wallet funds, they could easily find ways to move that to their accounts.  
If you do have anything in your inventory they'll obviously take/trade/sell that stuff off.  
  
Sending them a friend request won't really get you in trouble.  You can troll them if you want.  But it really is best to report/block/ignore and move on.  The sooner you report them, the sooner Steam Support may be able to stop them from getting other potential victims.  
  
I've not heard of Steam Support punishing people from trying to troll scammers, but still seems like a waste of time to me.  The scammers already know some people will troll them and/or not be a victim.  So you're not really wasting their time in the grand scheme of things.

-	No need to be signed in to multiple devices.
-	Potentially less resource usage relative to main client.
-	Easier to automate i.e if you wanted to build a HTPC.
-	Potentially updated less frequently than the main client, reducing frequency of restarts.
-	And this is the big one: can probably be distributed on the App Store like on iOS (with purchasing/community disabled), thereby reaching a wider audience as there’s a significant market of people who exclusively install software through platform app stores.",Thanks.,Steam
Why...not just run the Steam client and stream through that? This seems silly.,"Steam client-based PC2PC streaming is:

Potentially unsafe compared to Link software (Link never needs your account credentials or stores them locally), does not stream the whole desktop session (unlike Link), is overly complicated (compared to the Link).

About Steam game keys themselves, if you buy in an actually legit site, the only thing you might really have to take into account sometimes is to not buy something restricted to a region that isn't yours (a well made website probably wouldn't show you the game anyways if you couldn't activate it where you are).

Also, refund policies for activated game keys are pretty much non-existent, compared to the 2weeks/2hours of Steam; some shops allows you to get a refund if you haven't revealed the key yet though. Besides that, it's pretty much the same.","Ok cool this helps a lot

From what I’d personally recommend, I would say the Half Life series as number one. Kingdom Come: Deliverance was also incredible on PC, and much easier with keyboard and mouse. Quake II received a full RTX upgrade and is worth checking out, as well as Deliver Us the Moon (worth about $10 imo). Hades is very well received, but may not be for everyone. Master Chief Collection is also very good and has lots of content. If you haven’t played the Metro series already, the first two were decent games (personally didn’t enjoy the second as much), but hot damn Metro Exodus is both visually the best game I’ve played and gameplay wise absolutely incredible.

It really sucks that Crash 4 isn't coming out to Steam... And how hard is Celeste? I haven't touched it yet but I wanna play it with achievements in mind.,I say it's not too bad since its small room design and fast respawn basically means you can brute force completing it with just a lot of time and dedication.

I’ve loved the Steam Controller for years and sometimes even prefer it to keyboard and mouse. I used it all the time at my old place to play my PC games on the TV. However, I recently moved into a new apartment and my PC is now too far from my tv to just run a long HDMI, so I went searching on a certain “local marketplace” where folks can offer things up for sale. And bam! I had to drive an hour for it but I am so stoked to try this out! 

Any tips/tricks/words of caution for a newbie to Steam Link?",Grab RetroArch. It is a 'sideload' app. You can also install Kodi and use the Steam Link to stream media. Beware trying to do anything over 720p with it. Make sure you have 802.11ac or above for your wifi solution.,Steam

"That sounds like it would open your system up to some really nefarious stuff. In today’s day and age, I don’t think this is a good idea at all (especially considering all of the recent major hacks that have occurred). People are going to wind up getting their personal information stolen. 

There are already multiple services that offer something like this for people that don’t own a decent enough PC. And the PC’s they use don’t belong to anyone else, so there isn’t any information to get a hold of/viruses to install.

Game publishers (including Valve themselves) would also *hate* this. How are they going to sell games when they would be allowing people to rent everything they want to play? Theoretically, they’d only sell a fraction of what they’d normally sell (considering how convenient this service sounds). This would hurt the PC gaming marketplace.

EDIT: multiple changes","1) Steam would have to take security into account, yes, but it'd be no different than what a lot of games and/or launchers do now. My [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher downloads updates over an internal p2p network, so it's easier on their servers. To me, it'd be no different than that. Stadia and Geforce Now are already streaming to devices, so how is this any different?

2) I know there are a lot of other services that do similar things, but nothing that pays users directly, which is a huge selling point. This could be incorporated directly into Steam, the largest game store out there, with a huge userbase instantly. And given that Statia's being shut down, and Geforce Now has been slow to roll out, and how expensive it is to get something like this off the ground, it'd be an easier solution for Steam to implement compared to millions of dollars of datacenter servers. 

3) Why would game publishers hate this? You'd still have to buy the game, I'm not saying you can just play a game for free or for $1. Instead, a user can buy a game, buy 10 hours of streaming time, and instantly start streaming it (rather than waiting for a 100GB download) from a nearby user who has also purchased that game and has it installed on their PC. Or bundle a free 2 hours with a purchase so you can stream the game while it downloads and installs (or installs overnight).",Steam
I got a steam-link. Which is cool but still dependent on your gaming pc running to make it work. Rarely use it now because I am barely at the tv.,"That's not the same thing at all.

"I'm probably part of a tiny minority, but I boycott whole studios the moment they sign any paid exclusivity deal on PC (regardless of if it's EGS (though EGS is by far the biggest offender)

"This is all just opinion and I have no facts to fully back my position:  
  
The amount of actual consumers who where unhappy with Epic and Epic exclusives was a loud minority.  
To me it seemed the noise was loud, but not from that many (I mean EGS didn't tank, meaning people were still fine with using it and supporting what they were doing...or because Epic has other revenue streams that could help keep it afloat...business is weird).  
  
So yes there are probably some people who are still purposefully boycotting Epic thinking their lack of using that platform will help bring it to it's knees.  But considering Epic is a super rich company I doubt the amount of people boycotting it are causing any impact to EGS's bottom line.  
  
Most people don't really care.  One mega corp is the same as the other.  Steam makes billions a year, Epic makes however much they make a year. Neither of them actually care for you as a consumer no matter what their PR teams say.  
You can get some good free games from Epic without spending a dime with them, is that boycotting them, or helping them?  Who knows.  
  
In summary: yes people are.  But it probably doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.","> But considering Epic is a super rich company I doubt the amount of people boycotting it are causing any impact to EGS's bottom line.

They are.

Epic Store games simply do not sell well. 

The Epic Store made almost the same amount of revenue in 2020 as it did in 2019. This is very bad for a new game store in a year in which digital games were best-selling products. And this early in its lifespan, and with so many free games last year - you would expect massive growth from the past year. Nope.

Games like Satisfactory sold better on Steam than on Epic by an order of magnitude. Games like Fall Guys or Phasmophobia single-handedly generated more money on Steam than most of the entire Epic Store catalog for 2020.

> Neither of them actually care for you as a consumer no matter what their PR teams say.

Statements like this, absolute statements which are rhetorical rather than evidence-based, are worthless in a serious conversation on this complicated subject.

We don't know if any of them care; but we can see from their past activities and accomplishments that customers have benefited from what they've done. For example, Valve almost single-handedly resurrected the PC game market in 2007-2009 and are responsible for a major surge in PC ports and companies re-entering the PC game space in the interval 2015-2019.

Epic, on the other hand, said PC gaming was dying in 2007, and left the market. They came back now, because Valve did all the work for them. 

So while it's impossible to tell if any one of these companies legitimately cares about customers, we can certainly tell which one of them has done more for their customers and for the entire community of PC gamers and developers.

In fact, if you look at Epic, they do very little for the customers. They do a lot for developers through their cash deals, but consumers get the short end of the stick.",Steam

Then over a few years they polished it into the masterpiece that it is, just throwing that out there since we are so busy making comparisons about the two every 3 seconds.","Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game I see that benefits from being completely broken because of its bugs. The game is so full of bugs that people don't even think about the actual game, what it would be without bugs. And it's a completely mediocre game. 

People tend to think that time will fix this game, like it did with the witcher 3. The thing is that this game was so rushed, that not only optimization or bugfixes were completely ignored, but also whole systems like how the police works on an open world game, AI, animations, player/vehicle/weapon customization, and worst of all, the main story and side missions. Many aspects of the game will be fixed, but many others won't. It's simply impossible to fix certain things with a patch or a dlc. It'd require a re-release or something similar, and I doubt it'll happen in the near future.",Steam

"I remember the days when you could just call 1-800-4-MYXBOX at any time and get a good support rep.  Now, it seems that most M$ support has been reduced almost entirely to use a peer support system.  You live chat with some rando that doesn't actually work for them and MAYBE they can help you.  These people are not trained in any way, just regular users that have some experience with fixing problems.  The 800 number also directs you to these people off hours.    


I recently had a profile/permission issue that should have been relatively easy for an xbox rep to solve.  Instead, I talked to 4 different people who all suggested things that wouldn't have helped me whatsoever, including clearing my xbox cache, factory resetting (wiping) the console and creating a new gamer profile.  The issue turned out to be that my GF's console was (unknown to me) signing in to my account automatically along with hers and kicking one or the other of us out of a game when she tried to play while I was on my console. We both own separate copies of said game, so it should have worked, but it was detecting that I was already signed in and playing on my console and not even looking to see that she owned it.  I fixed it by removing my account from that xbox.","I've come to the realization that the bigger a company is, the worse their costumer support gets. Uber, Facebook-Instagram, Sony, The Government....",Steam
"I don't own the game, so don't know much about it.

What I know is that Microsoft has a help program on their service, so instead of talking to **real support** you can talk to ""Xbox gamer"" that opt in to this program that wants to help the xbox community. I found about this over year ago, when I was having account problems for Xbox, where if you visit help center website you be greeted with an option to post on the forums, or chat with ""Xbox gamer"", it took me about 5 minutes to find the correct path to contacting support about my account issue as for some reason my issue wasn't listed really which only support can fix on their end.

So my best bet is probably that wasn't real support, that just a user that doesn't know jack, or just doesn't really want to be very helpful the way this person relying to you, so I assume he/she expects you to go get an Xbox system, not resolve your PC issue.

Also do note that your Xbox account is your Microsoft account. Here the help page for the game to link, and unlink account.

If you by chance change your password, your email, or the xbox tag name on the Microsoft / Xbox account, you just want to update your sign in, so logout in-game, then log back in, and should update. IDK if that an option to logout in-game, so if you have to maybe try unlink instead, then relink.

Grim Dawn is a great game.  I know they talked about a console release but I'm not sure if they ever actually did it.  If you enjoy this genre, this is arguably the best game in it.

Remember that on PC you have access to almost everything from previous generations.  Is there a game from your past that you loved but can't play any longer?  Look for it on PC.  The original Baldur's Gate games for example if you enjoy CRPG.

Also take note that you have MOBA and MMO available to you.  Those options are extremely limited on consoles.  I really enjoyed Star Wars: The Old Republic, it's on Steam.  Free to play up to level 60 and the first two expansions.  Subscribing for one month ($15) will unlock literally all the content released into the game over the past decade.

Other MMO would be Final Fantasy XIV, but that's also on console.  Guild Wars 2 is great in my opinion but not on Steam.  Have to use their exclusive launcher.  It is due to release on Steam eventually but I don't know when.

I think applying GIFs will lower the quality just like mine,"Ohh. Hmm yeah that makes sense. Just with music, some file formats have lower quality.

It's on Gmod and the guy had lie 17k hours. The review was something like ""I've played it a bit, it's pretty good."" Imo, no meme review can really top that",Steam
"Unfortunately, for better or for worse, humor of any sort will top informative stuff when it comes to being popular. Videogamedunkey made a fun video comparison about it a little while back. Most people don't care nearly as much about learning as they do about getting a quick laugh, and don't care if the content is lazy and repetitious, because it makes them comfortable to get stuck in that rut.

This is why you use the filter and go straight to only looking at the negative reviews. In general, they are far more detailed and helpful because most of those people are arguing against a popular viewpoint and actually have to formulate an argument to support their points to get any notice at all. Of course there's still lots of trash, but usually there's some quality viewpoints when doing this. Very few games exist where this doesn't apply. It works for something like Bioshock Infinite, but it won't work for something like Terraria (but then again, really, who could possible hate Terraria, lol. Even if you did, giving it a negative review considering the absurd amount of quality content and decade long support would most likely be unfair, unless you have some really good points about the base game design, which is totally possible!)

I'm the kind of person who writes 5000 word guides for games, complete with stats and fun images and stuff, and I also regularly reach the word count on my reviews on Steam. These guides took a fair amount of time to complete, and have been updated over the years to stay as accurate as possible, and I've gotten a reasonable amount of awards on my guides considering how many have seen them (not that many people but still). However, I am still completely and utterly dwarfed in terms of attention and awards by people who write ""game is good for my review here is a pancake recipe lol XDXDXD"" and post that.

Does that make me mad? Well, no, not really, because I know that the content I've created reaches the people who actually care and are invested in it, and I'm very thankful to those random strangers out there who are willing to spend the equivalent of even a single dollar to grant me an award, or leave a nice comment. If people wanna spend money on a joke, then far be it from me to stop that. That said, I do wish there were higher quality standards for Steam reviews, so that the system was actually useful to those wanting to view a more detailed explanation of what makes a game good/bad.","Yeah, this comment shows that you're the type of people to write 500 word reviews, but i mean, do people really use the steam review system? If you just wanna know if it's good or for you you just need to see some gameplay, the tags and see what most people think, if you really want a in depth review then just look at a video or article, is more readable if you look at it and if you're lazy or wanna see more of it then the video format is also good, appart that reviews is just to help people decide if they will or won't buy a game and maybe even if everyone thinks that the game is a 10/10 there could be a change tjst you just don't like it

Btw i'm sorry for my engrish, this comment really shows that i'm not s native english speaker lol",Steam

"You can simply ignore it tho, it's not like you will die because of seeing someone doing a joke, i know that it can bother people, but it's also really stupid to bitch about someone doing it when you can always filter the reviews, like if you are already looking for information of the game, just do a few more clicks",Says you!

Lets not forget that the second post was also just some attention whore trying to gain attention from the first attention whore. Its all heartless and pointless dumb shit. 

I think the real problem is too many people these days either don't know how to think for themselves and actually post things from their own heart or intuition, or they are just to afraid to post anything from the heart or from their own intuition out of fear of being rejected.

"First, if there is a known major sale that's date has been leaked, it'll be listed on https://steamdb.info/sales/history/  
  
Secondly, I know what you are asking, but I feel compelled to share this answer:  THERE IS ALWAYS A SALE.  
  
^^Note: ^^All ^^Times ^^are ^^PST/PDT  
**Daily Deals**.  - Start every day at 10AM . The item put on sale usually is on sale for 48 hours.  
**Weeklong Deals**.  - Starts Monday at 10AM , usually goes through Friday at 10AM.  
**Midweek Madness**. - Starts Tuesdays at 10AM ending Thursday at 10AM.  
**Weekend Deals**.  - Starts Thursday at 10AM , usually goes through Monday 10 AM.  
**Free Weekends**.  - Deal times are same as Weekend Deals, the game you can play for free usually stops being free Sunday afternoon even though the deal is usually good through Monday at 10AM.  
**Publisher week/weekends**.  - Dates/days vary and aren't known ahead of time.  
**Anniversary Sales**.  - Dates/days vary and aren't known ahead of time.  
**Event Sales** (Quakecon, May the 4th/StarWars, Anime weekend, shoot-em up sale, Golden Week, others I can't remember that they do randomly throughout the year).  - Dates/days vary and aren't known ahead of time.  
  
Then there are the major sales, exact dates aren't known/100% certain until the information leaks 1-2 weeks before they start...if they leak at all.  They will all start at 10AM on whatever day:  
**Lunar Sale** (Late January/Early February?)  
**Spring Cleaning Event** (Starts like a month or so before the Summer Sale, not really a sale as more of just an event to play your backlog)  
**Summer Sale** (Starts mid/late June)  
**Winter Sale** (Starts mid/late December)  
**Halloween Sale** (Around Halloween every year)  
**Autumn Sale** (Around US Thanksgiving weekend)  
  
AND THEN ON TOP OF ALL THAT:  Publisher/developers can put their game(s) on sale whenever they damn well feel like.  Released new DLC?  Make the entire franchise on sale!  It's the 12th of the month? 12% off all our games!  etc and so forth.  - These can vary on both date/time as a publisher can choose to end a sale at midnight if they felt like doing so. 
  
So, summary: **THERE IS ALWAYS A SALE!**  
  
Side notes:  
There are also lots of other retailers like Humble, Fanatical, etc that have their own set of sales which include games you can activate on Steam!  
Use sites like [isthereanydeal.com](https://isthereanydeal.com/) to see price history and lowest prices across multiple stores on games you want!

Right click Crysis on your steam --> Manage --> CD key,OP said this doesn't work.,Steam
"Yeah somehow it's broken. I bought Crysis on Steam many years ago, but only played it for the first time a week ago and facing this exact same issue.

I ended up using executables from https://github.com/ccomrade/c1-launcher

It worked and I beat the game couple days later. Maybe you can give it a try. Good luck.",my speculation is that its broken right now intentionally because people were abusing the manage cd key options and ea play on Steam to get the games through the sub then managing the Origin keys to sell for profit on grey market sites like G2A to make money off Valve and EA so I believe once it was known and exposed that they blocked managing keys while they try and close the exploit.,Steam
" Ya, know the feeling, I bought Crysis in 2019, and same issue won't request the CD key, just sits there. Then Steam tells you to contact EA for their support. When I contact EA, they shifted me from one department to the next with the same results, no cd key, their live chat support never connects, so end result again no way of playing the game. Steam will not refund the money, and now I have a game I can not play. Steam will only refund if you bought the game in the last 2 weeks. I spent about 2 weeks trying to get the cd key. I swear they do this stuff on purpose just to mess you up.
 So how do I proceed, well I am going to contact the CAFC and file a report with them, since Steam (3rd party seller) and EA are selling games that are useless and pretty much are defrauding the people out of their money instead of just taking the game off the market. If they can not produce CD keys for the game then they should not be selling it either.",Thanks for taking the time to do this! We need to make sure they take responsibility for their products!,Steam
"Crafting card sets into badges gives you a profile background and an emoticon for the game (in addition to the badge, which you can display on your profile.)

I only have 1 friend on steam, and he's my nephew. I don't play MP very often.",Steam
"People absolutely do buy cards, no idea about achievements, but I would guess it's the same.

Converting into gems allows you to craft booster packs, so if you're out of cards for a badge you want, you can attempt that.

Usually, people want to craft a badge and games never give you enough card drops to craft badges without trading, so that's the reason behind that market actually moving. That, and the possibility to actually actually make some small amounts of money if you are not interested in badges.",That's interesting. I actually never even noticed all the stuff I've accumulated.

They would need to pay 30% to Valve and 30% to Apple\Google.  

Plus - to use Apple\Google pay, developer need to sign some very limiting agreement, so they are not allowed to sell game cheaper on other places. And IIRC you are not allowed to sell DLC outside of their systems, so if you bough a game using one of mobile payment systems - you are tied to this system for all future payments for this game.","I don't know what you are talking about 30% thing.

Good concept. It's weird that you have to follow a link from an e-mail to see where you got an award. And I'm not sure why you have to wait 2 weeks until you receive your points.,The two weeks are to avoid issues with refunds (since if you refund a game you lose all points you got from it and whatever you spent them on).,Steam

"i cant help with most of the questions but the game festivals were designed from the start to be the short limited time events intended to showcase upcoming games that may not get seen otherwise. The event format allows for more highlighting of games and dev streams and such during the event and also limited time prompts more users to check it out rather then if they were just available all the time.

Personally with the lack of demos for most games I think another event is great.  They can keep the demos on Steam afaik after the event is over but there is debate over whether demos hurt sales so I would assume a lot of studios do not want a demo that is just kept all the time and again that would mean the event has a bit less impact without the play this now before it goes away sort of stuff.  


As for the demos on their own websites that is probably up to the publisher/dev and for the same reason they may not want a full time demo on Steam they may not want like an early demo on a website that is available all the time. 

I prefer to think of those demo events as like virtual conventions. If you go to say PAX and check out the indie megabooth the games can only be played during the time the convention floor is open for example and at least with the festivals you can play anytime during the festival and it doesnt like close at night.","yes but PAX is usually the whole game so they don't need to make a demo. These are demos that have been made, they already put in the effort and then it's wasted. I'm not sure they'd get more interest by being in a hard to find section of Steam for a limited time that people might not even be around for, than if they also came back a few weeks after that, or had a time limit on the demo itself of a few days etc, it's just arbitrary and weird.

Someone PM'd me a list of reasons which they think are great and I think are completely wrong. Demo's are an old concept? no there's more demos than ever. Publishers hate demos? it's marketing. Developers hate demos? it's marketing. It's the new state of demos? nope, it's just a dumb idea by steam execs that hardly has a point and needs rethinking.",Steam

Yes you both keep your separate libraries as they are now. But in your friends steam client there will be a new category called ""NoneFlatEarthBoi's games"" that shows your library (and vice versa).

So each of you sees two (or more if more people participate) libraries. But in order to play a game from a library nobody else can play a game from that particular library. (Which game doesn't matter, f2p doesn't matter.) But merely being online will not lock any library. Only playing a game from it will.

He playing a game from his library means you can't. Somebody else playing a game from his library means you can't. He playing a game from your library means you kick him out if you start playing one of your own games. But you can play one of his as long as no third person is already using his library.

So yes, you example will work.","So, if he's playing a gane from my library and I start playing another game from my library, will he get kicked?",Steam

however the downside is going to be getting a start game experience rather than chosen sections of interesting gameplay - depending on the game type. But 2 hrs is more than an enough to get a general idea of what your getting yourself into. But like a good book it should hook you in pretty early, no one can help if your unhappy in late game, you were never going to get the full feel of the difficulty curve etc.",I believe it's 14 days of purchase or 2 hours of gameplay actually,Steam
"All you need is a 12 hours game play refund policy. After playing 12 hours, you can't refund but if you hate it, yeah full refund please.",Yeah good reason behind the 2 hour policy so you can't beat it and refund it. Reminds me of a game on Quest I beat just past the 2 hour mark. I tried refunding it cause I was mad it was only 2 hours but sadly nope lol,Steam
"I want game trailers that feature actual game play, not a minute long video with 2 second clips of gameplay cut between black screens with text with testimonies.",Reminds me of MGS4 when you press the button and snake sees flashbacks lol.,Steam
I just use steams refund policy as a demo,"But that requires dedicating 15 hours to downloading.  I've been wanting to get Mass Effect Andromeda since it came out, but my PC is low end, and the thing stopping me is putting all that work in just to find out I can't run it.  And it has to be done in a timely manner to keep the refund as an option, I can't just let it download all 17 hours over the course of a week.  I wholeheartedly agree with this premise for that reason alone.  I'm not worried the games will be bad and I will want a refund, by the time I buy I know what to expect, but there are far too many variables to account for with PC gaming.  It doesn't even have to be a proper demo, just let me run a benchmark and experiment with the settings a bit.  Probably not a big issue to people in Europe, with their internet speeds, but nothing sucks like watching that damn counter in hopeful anticipation that you will be playing the game tonight, just to reach the climax and see it running at 4 FPS.",Steam
"Stop buying games day one 
Wait for reviews or watch someone play 
Buy if ur up for it","even still somtimes games look fun on video, but when playing you don't enjoy it.",Steam
Making a demo needs time and effort to do it. It is not as simple as just taking one level of the game and post it as a demo.,"It can be that simple, but some times is not. But sometimes it can just be this.",Steam
"I think they stop doing because of the rise of the Internet, if you want to find out about a game all you have to do is search it up and look and videos showing off the gameplay and reviews to know if it’s any good. 

All Demos did was cherrypick certain parts of a game because they were probably the most fun part of the game and either made you complete a level or play for a limited time.",I've also read that developers found that they didn't actually make a significant difference for potential buyers.,Steam
I mean u can return the game b4 24 hrs after purchase,You have 2 weeks to return it.,Steam
"I upvote, but these days you can kind of try before you let them keep the money. Try before you buy is always better but games are getting bigger so getting a feel for them within a few hours is getting harder and harder. As a result, demos get more and more redundant.

Steam needs to catch up to other platform's (Edit: I mean platforms like GoG, Uplay etc... not consoles) policies & increase the measly 2 hour limit to at least 10 hours minimum. On top of this, if you get the free weekends or play the demos, it can sometimes count towards those 2 hours, so you're in a bit of trouble if you buy it & actually realise it's not so great.","10 hours seems excessive. A lot of single-player story driven games I've played/wanted to play take less than that to complete.

2 hours should be plenty of time to give you an idea what the game is about, what it looks like, how well the controls are, what accessibility options are available, how well you can optimise the game and how well it performs on your system etc.

You should always read reviews and watch gameplay videos before buying anything you're unsure about anyway.

I think demos are still a good idea to address the above instead of abusing Steam's refund policy.

If you incur over two hours of playtime, Steam should still provide a refund if the reason given is genuine and reasonable.",Steam
"Tbf Steam refund exists for this. Origin had it as well IIRC.

Still, better to have a free download vs. having to spend 60 bucks first, to then get it refunded X days later.","In origin you cant refund a game if you launched it once, happened to me when i got bf5",Steam
Check out Black Mesa.,"I second this, Black Mesa is essentially a remake of the original Half-Life. It’s engine is based off an improved version of Source and it’s easily playable on a mid-range PC.",Steam
"What makes you feel that the client is better to use? Genuine question.

I happen to believe the exact opposite: I almost exclusively use my browser when doing anything with Steam, whether it's browsing stuff on the store or using the market, anything really except for browsing my own library.

I find it far better than the client. The biggest reason why is being able to easily open multiple tabs and it is generally faster and more responsive in a browser, I feel.

And no your suggestion isn't really doable. The only thing that can be modified in the client is the skin. Complicated addons cannot be added to the client, just skins that customize how the client looks.",I think I'm just used to it... but I guess I could change. It just feels kinda weird to have Steam open in a tab. Its just a strange feeling when I've been using the Client for so long.,Steam
"In my opinion, it's best to have it unlinked.",Ok will do just that and also put in 2FA,Steam

"Same here. Imagine having a multi-billionaire company and not having stable servers. Imagine every time being ""surprised"" by the amount of users who are trying to buy games during big sales.   


Today was my day off and I planned to get Halo for me and my girlfriend so we can play a bit coop. Too bad for me, right?","I hear this a lot, but the problem is, this is normal and probably budgeted.  
You cannot scale (actually you dont want) a whole server system for a peak of users accessing for a couple days.  
As a company they want to scale their server system for an average X amount of users, actually you kind scale a bit lower than the average, but let's say for simplicity you just scale for the average.  
Let's say for example they scale for 1m users, if they expect 5m users loggin in for a couple of days for sales period, they cant just buy servers capacity to cover that peak, for obivous reasons, cause they will find themselves with useless server capacity and cost for the rest of the year.  
So they most probably increase a bit server capacity, maybe rent from a third party, and actually account some of the downtime as simply a cost, and balance the expected earning of the sales with expected cost (included downtime).  
  
It is the same for every game at day one, it isnt like game companies dont expect server downtime or a burst of players, it that is preferable some downtime compared to buy a huge server capacity that wont be profitable in the long period.  
  
It isnt their first sale, and really they have dozens of people managing these situations, you can expect most of the times that things are just planned, and well sometime also screw up, but I personally believe they expected some downtime.",Steam

"Update: Now over 24 hours since my original purchase attempt of six games. Three show in my library but can't be installed; I get a pop-up saying the ""purchase is pending,"" the other three games don't show in my library at all.

I just called my bank and they confirmed that the full payment did indeed go through on their end. Meanwhile, Steam support told me to try the purchase a second time...which doesn't make sense since three of the games already show as ""owned"" and can't be purchased a second time on the same account, and regardless, I would be charged a second time!

My bank told me that in the worst case scenario, I should make a fraud dispute to see if I can block and reverse the charge, but this will take days (and the sale will be over by then).

They want people to get on their platform but all they do to achieve it is annoying.

"Hi r/Steam

Today I noticed an email on my garbage email account that I use time to time as a burner, mostly.

Now I changed both passwords. Maybe I should terminate that email address since it's exposed almost everywhere. Anyway, here is the 4 years badge on an account from 2009. :)

My first account is from 2006 and still couldn't find it yet. Maybe I need a second Indian guy.","If you choose to make new email, ensure to enable 2FA on it as well, this way you sleep like a baby. 2FA helps a lot for extra added layer of security.",Steam
"You already have heard this all morning, but you're gonna want to change all of your passwords, even stuff you very rarely use.

In this way, some criminals are able to profit without anything tying them directly to any of the individual attacks.

Those databases are then sold off piecemeal by username or social security number all over the world. 

There's no telling if they just got your steam account, or they've received a full dump of logins from dozens of sites. 

2FA saved you here, but there's no telling if they also got access to any old email accounts or something sensitive like banking details.","Still thanks for warning.

It was not my main account on any real accounts of mine. So I believe I'm kinda safe. It was my carelessness, I know I should've changed the password ions ago even if it is a burner account.

And Ubisoft doing the opposite of it...,"Ubisoft has a pretty sweet deal with Epic. They have Epic's exclusivity deal, but it doesn't extend to Uplay. Since most people who are interested in Ubisoft games already buy it from Ubi directly, Epic loses money on the deal- it's very unlikely every Ubi exclusive has enough sales on EGS to pay back the advance.

Epic basically just gets to say they have a partnership with one of the biggest AAA studios, and they seem happy with that. I suppose it buys them a degree of credibility and a bit of extra marketing too.",Steam

I don't buy that purely because the port was done by two separate teams. HZD port was and still is pretty bad. Having been done by a third party studio, Virtuos. GG had nothing to do with it as they were and still are busy with Forbidden West. 

DS on the other hand was ported by Koji Pro themselves and ended up being a fairly respectable port.

Don't think it had anything to do with it being easier since I doubt Virtuos and Koji Pro were sharing anything with each other.

"One thing Origin has over Steam. I played Apex Legends on Origin for the longest time. I have a friend with down syndrome who likes to play but isn't that great for obvious reasons, so I would log into a different account to play with him because the lobbies on my main account were just insane and he could not keep up. So we would play on my alt account and the lobbies were much easier on him and he enjoyed it a lot more.

On origin this is as simple as logging out and back in with your other account. Tried to do this on steam and nope. My main steam account is now tied to my main Apex Legends account. I was hoping I could unlink it and link my alt account, but I would have to make a new steam account to link it to instead. I don't want to do that. 

It's not a huge deal, I play with him maybe once or twice a month at best. So I'm on my main account 99% of the time. But if I wanted to switch, it would be much easier on Origin. I have it installed on origin as well just to play with my friend and play on Steam most of the time.","This is extremely rare. To say that a downside of steam is not really fair.

In english the template is `${gameName} franchise`, but in Portuguese it's `série ${gameName}`, for instance.

One safer way to do it would be to validate on Steamworks when the client tries to submit a franchise title that ends with ""franchise"", just show a warning saying ""this thing doesn't need to end in 'franchise' unless that's the actual name of your franchise.

[http://battlegrounds.party/weapons/raw/](http://battlegrounds.party/weapons/raw/)

||G36C|M4|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Damage|41|40|
|Initial Bullet Speed|870|780|
|Recoil Climb Vert/Horiz|11Horiz, 17Vert|12Horiz,12Vert|
|TTK 3Vest Upperchest (the only difference)|0.343|0.428|
|Time between shots|0.0857|0.0857|
|Vert Recoil Variation|0.1|0.1|
|Vert Recoil Max/Min|7/NA|7/0.05|
|Reload Scalar(higher is faster? AK is 0.9)|1.1|0.69|
|RecoverySpeed\_Vertical|8|7|

Let's break this down, I'm not an expert nor *really* know what I'm looking at but I can take an educated guess.

The G36c jumps faster, but recovers faster. With less Horizontal deviation, it makes the vert grip more ideal (you could even say dependent upon).

They have the same ROF so the 1 Damage difference only applies on 3vests (assuming they're full HP, if they're not the difference is lessened)

The G36C has no minimum recoil vert deviation, so you can get a lucky tight spray? Where as the M4 is more predictable so you can better use your load-out, discouraging trying for a lucky spray.

The G36C base stats are very similar to the M4, but with the M4 you've got the interactions from the TacStock.

*- 20.00% Recoil Pattern Scale* (Reduced recoil all around, probably.)*+ 10.00% ADS Speed* (If you're spraying with a scope, TacStack has more value, ADS speed difference w/ Red-Dot is already so minimal)*+ 5.00% Recoil Recovery- 10.00% Animation Kick* (Staying on target is easier when *animations* jumps less)*- 10.00% Sway* (Keeping a bead is easier, sway occurs during sprays too.)*- 5% Deviation* (0.95 multiplier on things recoil related)

&#x200B;

* RecoilMultiplierHorizontal: 0.95 (5% decrease in horizontal)
* RecoilMultiplierVertical: 1 (TacStock doesn't drastically improve Vert recoil, still scalar and recoil recovery, sway etc just impacts horizontal greater)
* RecoilRecoveryMultiplier: 1.05 (5% faster recovery rate)","This is great, Thanks. But I remembe rin one of the updates the Bullet speed of M4 was nerfed to 780 M/s or something like that",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

If anything the PUBG definition of griefing deserves some explanation/definition. And subsequent bans should have a form of moderation, not automation.

"well, cars are complex geometry compared to walls/roofs, pretty sure it's rather tricky for devs to make it work.","Climbing/Vaulting is based on traces and collision hulls. Coding vaulting/climbing is trivial at best.

Basics ... on input line trace forward for vault/climb object. On hit get its height. Determine can I climb/vault it. Determine if there's enough room for the character to fit on top of it. Next get its depth. Determine if its wide enough to stand on. If I can stand on it...climb up. Otherwise vault over it.

The other aspect is how the flow control is set up for key binds.

Is jump bound to the same key?  For vaulting do I need to keep pressing forward (forward movement input scalar 1.0)?

On (jump/vault) input -> is Forward > 0.0 ? If True -> can I vault?..is the depth of the object too deep? No -> vault, Else check for climb conditions, ELSE jump.

\- - - - - - - - - - - -

Meshes themselves don't have collision. You have to add collision hulls to them.

Vehicle collision hulls aren't per poly complex. They're generally simplified shapes. Most game assets will have a *collision complexity* setting of ""Use Simple Collision as Complex"". This means that no matter what request you task to the collision (Physics or Query only) you're using the simple collision.

The mesh might be high poly, but the collision itself will not be. Collision triangles and vertices counts have a performance impact on physics and query calculations. Keeping them as low poly as possible helps quite a bit. Floating point precision etc. This applies to ALL mesh actors in game.

Vid highlighting Simple vs Complex Collisions [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRYxkbGgHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRYxkbGgHc)

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Moving forward you need to understand the collision of the character (Pawn). In Unreal Engine we use a Capsule Collision Component. [https://i.imgur.com/oj1lvfm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oj1lvfm.jpg) It's simply a capsule shaped collision hull.

All of our movement inputs apply to the capsule itself.. not the mesh. The skeletal mesh is the visual representation of the pawn. It's attached to the capsule (child of). Where the capsule goes, the pawn goes. Plainly put, we don't move the mesh, we move the capsule.

With jumping you need to be able to get high enough to get on top of the jump on to object. This can be tricky considering the capsule base is curved. Too much overhang and you'll slide off.

This ties directly back in to vaulting when the jump and the vault key is the same. Vaulting/Climbing in most implemented cases requires forward movement input (holding W down). This helps determine the inputs intention.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

I reported this player. Number 3 in pubg leaderboard. I reported him for wallhacking. Checked the box after reviewing the replay. 

So the final outcome is that I apparently reported him for teaming. 

And he has a 3 day temp ban. 

And pubg says they are doing everything they can. But apparently you can just cheat to top of the leaderboard. 

I want answers. I want to know why we are getting so much rubbish regarding cheating. This guy should be stripped of title immediately. 

Why innocent people are banned over and over again.. while the real cheaters are left alone to cheat away. 

Clean up the leaderboard. Vet and audit the top 500. Send a strong message.","You're not going to get any answer from the devs, but I'll give you an unsatisfying one: the game is on life support, its made most of the money it's going to make so most devs will have been moved to different projects or let go.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

hope this neckbeard sleeps like a baby at night knowing he uses cheats to unskillfully work his way to the top of the leaderboards in a game which requires a lot of skill and dedication.  I bet they sit at home cheating the government out of money while living in their moms cold dark basement as well.,"But this is it. When I first picked up the game (around 3 weeks into release on console) I simply didn't stop playing. I went to work, came home, had a cuppa or whatever and played for hours upon hours. Long into the night, even before my driving test(s) (always ended up with a chicken dinner, I feel it was my mind taking my mind off of the test, if that makes sense? 😂). I racked up 1300+ hours from day of purchase to now, it sits as my most played game ever (closely followed by Destiny 2 at 1270 hours). I got insanely good, then stopped playing for around 6 months. It really does take dedication, and it does indeed take skill. I've been in situations where I have absolutely no right winning the match (no vest, helmet, down to my last mag of ammo etc, you know the drill). It's probably why I'm against people just running the Beryl/SLR combo, because it was a real crutch setup (and still is, even ran into a player recently who's name was literally BerylM7whateverxxx, beat me in the final circle with a damn Beryl, funnily enough 😂), because I've won with nearly every weapon in the game. I don't rely on specific weapons apart from maybe the bolties, very handy endgame 😂. 

I played it enough back in the day to know when people were definitely cheating, and I can confidently say I never ran into dickheads that were using aimbots or whatever. I have definitely run into teamers, and they're usually that piss poor that if even if they did get the drop on me I'd shit on their heads. Pathetic shitbags that literally have to team/cheat to actually win. I might get angry, I might accuse people of hacking/cheating, but if I carried on playing religiously like I had back in the day, I would definitely be on some of these player's levels.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

"I agree wholeheartedly with the call for a ban here. But....         

Do leaderboards mean anything outside of the game? Do you get paid for being on the leaderboard? Are top leaderboard players getting invited to tournaments? Are these players allowed to continue hacking in these tournaments?               

I assume the answer to most if not all of these questions is ""no"". My only point being that leaderboards don't matter nearly as much as a player actually hacking. I don't care what their position is on the leaderboard or what ""title"" it grants them. If they hack, they should get banned.       

Calling for vetting/auditing on the top 500 is an absolute waste of resources.","Yes they do mean a lot. It means a lot to the cheater. The cheater is unhealthy obsessive using cheat tools to climb the ranks. You vet and audit the leaderboard, you strike fear in the hearts of these idiots. You send a strong message.

If you don't want downtime, don't die. The feeling that dying actually matters is one of the only things that makes this game different from the 1000 other arcadey BRs.

* first 5-10 minutes of the game only?

* 2 revives per squad? 1 per duo? 

* last long, you can't revive when your teammate is attacked? So no CQC revives.

"If you're sure nothing has changed about your settings, and your hardware itself isn't at fault, typically weird issues like this are software related somehow, and it's not easy to figure out what's causing it. Driver issues, issues with the PUBG install, or issues with your OS.

First recommendation is do a clean install of graphics drivers. delete the old ones, reinstall fresh ones.

If that didn't work, next step would be to uninstall and completely reinstall the game. Save your settings file so you can copy it over, but have everything else be a complete fresh install (don't just use steam to uninstall and reinstall immediately after, you need to uninstall, delete any files leftover, shut down the computer, turn it back on, then reinstall so steam is forced to get all of the files fresh again). If that doesn't fix it it's not the PUBG files themselves that are causing the problem.

Last step when you've ruled out everything else is to just reinstall windows. It's a pain in the ass but when you've ruled out hardware issues, driver issues, or issues with the game itself, the last culprit is  something with the OS that you're never going to figure out, so just nuking it and starting fresh is the easiest way of dealing with it.

I had to do this with CSGO a few years ago because one day I was randomly getting nowhere near the FPS I got just the day prior. I tried everything else and ultimately nothing worked until I just reinstalled windows.

It's always a good reason to reinstall every once in a while because windows gets slower and slower over time. If it still runs like shit and you have made sure that your CPU isn't thermal throttling then you have eliminated most of the possible reasons I already listed.

Next time just say GG!",Your decision maker is good bro. Nothing wrong here. They just upset they lose 2v1.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"* They had more cover then you
* They had you outnumbered
* The timer was running down
* When one of them said they should rush forward, that was the play they should have made.

&#x200B;

Instead, they threw smoke, provided you cover and then moved forward at a late time.

You played themselves.",They had the advantage in so many ways and just botched it. They’re positioning was so fucking perfect in this situation idk how they managed to lose tbh,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Ah yes, the most over powered weapon in the game, the VSS?","It's essentially a better m4 though.

More damage per shot, less recoil, better TTK.

Just because no one is using it because it is really hard to hit shit over 100m or being forced into a 3x even though the gun is best at close range, doesn't mean the actual stats are trash. The gun is indeed cracked.

It just makes no sense to play with VSS instead of an M4 because M4 allows you to do more things. However if VSS had 40 bullets in the mag or allow you to have a red dot, everyone would be running that thing until it gets nerfed as it's simply a better than m4.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

Agreed for the nonsense rant from this supposed streamer nobody ever heard of but...I mean I read outplayed in the title but in the video all I saw was lots of proning and random nades throwing lol,"This is a game about decision making, outplaying someone doesn't mean it has to be flashy. If you lose a 2v1 against someone who has no armor and no cover, guess what? You got majorly outplayed. Humor me - how would you have played this with no armor/no cover and without going prone?

If you're not an experienced player I can see how this doesn't look that impressive - but this was a kobayashi maru, a no-win situation - they had every advantage on me and yet they still lost. 

Also my nades weren't random - I had spotted them earlier so I knew where they were at, and my main purpose of throwing them was to give me time to reposition and try to gain info. Utility is useful for more than just one thing at a time.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

You stooped to their level and then some. Yeah, they talked some trash, but imo this is way worse. They sound like a new player so you are probably better than them. But just let your skill do the talking. This stuff is petty as hell. Can't stand this whiny expose culture.","I made this video because I thought his reaction was hilarious, and it seems like a lot of others did as well - it was all in good fun. FWIW He's level 500 in game, whereas I'm around level 230 (I have ~1300hrs in PUBG, but I'm not sure how that compares -most of that time was before leveling was implemented, I hit a point a while ago where I can only stand playing for an hour or two per week). 

But really, if he was new to the game that'd make his reaction even more funny - someone being literally a noob and complaining about someone else using a ""noob gun""? That'd be comedy gold. I'd also argue that him reacting that way on stream isn't encouraging to new players in any way either, and worse than my video - even if my video could be considered less-than-savory.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"“Outplayed” ... first of all, it was a completely average kill. Second, you are kind of a bitch for still using a vector late game. It’s literally the noob tube of PUBG. Lastly, the guy wasn’t really THAT salty. We all get salty time to time after dying. But the amount of time you spent editing this video and then posting to Reddit is kinda cringe tbh.","I only said I outplayed them, which is true - with how I played it it didn't matter what gun I used - I never said anything about the ""quality"" of the kills, because in my opinion that doesn't matter, a wins a win - also it took like 5mins to edit that, lmao.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

half grip master race,"Yep, golden middle way.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Thumb Grip for M4 and Vertical on the Beryl,"Same for me, angled works great on the beryl as well",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"My grip choice varies depending on the weapon, I voted under the assumption that we're talking about a full auto weapon being used in full auto mode. For an SKS i will always try to use vertical grip if it is available, for mutant i'll get shot instead of picking it up 

Half grip for me",I always get the feeling that SKS is much worse with vertical than without a grip. Lightweight followed by half and thumb for me. Agree on the Mutant tho.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"I used to prefer the half grip until I realized something I think most people overlook.  The bounce from initial shot is higher than other grips.  I think this contributed to inconsistencies, especially when lean-spraying.

As you say, vertical recoil is more predictable so angled is the way to go. Then for me it’s vert, thumb, then half.","I think people don’t quite take into account the real life application of the gun. Most of it relies on the first 5 shots. The half grip is not the best for the first volley of bullets. The thumbgrip is great for quick ADS and a sharp spray of 5 bullets. 

Obviously the vertical grip is going to help when the spray is held longer.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Lightweight grip to spray and tap for me. Yes, it has no vertical recoil reduction, but it has the absolute best 1-2 bullet spread, and thus the first 5 bullets are grouped tightest with the lightweight than any other grip. I run it on my m4/scar and use a 3x for pretty much 90% of the time. If My crosshair is on the player model, its a laser beam and goes exactly where i need it to with my initial shots. Just a preference thing.","Could you tell me the difference between m4 and scar? I see that most pro player use M4, but not scar.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

crazy. just two gascans or how many did you use?,"This one was 12 cans.

6 cans gives you about 100m

8 is about 150-200

10 is around 300

12 is 450

14 I assume is probably 700

16 gives you 1km car launch - video below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpd7FHjxAbc


Remember your C4 has a 16 second timer.  If you are solo you'll  lose 6 seconds (grenade 5 second timer). In a squad you probably want to give your C4 thrower a second or two to get away.

"I would consider trying to play without that all core overclock.

"This will most likely not be popular but...you're delusional if you think there is a permanent solution to cheating. If there was, PUBG Corp could shut this game down and make millions just from selling their impenetrable anti-cheat solution to every other online game that also have to deal with cheaters. 

If you're asking about hardware bans then you obviously have no knowledge on the subject and have done 0 research into why they don't work.

Reporting people that you think are cheating does have action taken against them - if you're reporting them and they're not being banned then maybe they're not cheating? There's also PUBG Shield that you can use to report people too.",">There's also PUBG Shield

Only certain regions...

I agree in most things, one thing though that blows my mind is how a multi billion company 2021 cant fight cheaters better.

1. Yes, there will never ever be a permanent solution (ofcourse)

But when there is nothing or noone reacting when (often new) accounts have 50-80% winratio in hundreds of games, and/or 10-20 kills average....

If they could have theese obvious cheaters (mostly) automatically flagged and sent for review it would save a LOT of pain from the legit players.

Even better would be that instead of banning their pathetic ass, they was sent to a different queue where there is only confirmed cheaters and maybe some of them take longer time before they start ruin the game again for legit players.

ALSO, on top of this, they must be able to have a database of banned players (ip/hardware/whatever??) and if a new account gets created and matched with this list, the bar of getting auto flagged should be even lower...

This can not be impossible 2021.... ?",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

"i have  2k hours, i think I've come across only like 4 blatant cheaters in that whole time, which i admit is a lot lower than some, but still, although it is an issue, imo for me its as big as an issue as people make it out to be, this is probably unpopular opinion.","Your comment adds not much to the statistics...

Let me explain why, some players dont even know what to look for in a cheater.

Some players with your claims, never even watch a replay, or even have it active.

And some drop hot, kill a few, die #54 and in theese cases the chances of running into the cheater(s) that round is SO much more slim

Compared to a tryhard camper who have a high win/top10 ratio, who is MUCH more likely to meet the cheater since they are often winning or atleast getting into the end.

If you could show you have 10-20% winratio and 40-60% top 10 stats on your id, your claims would be much more valid.

However you could still not be good in spotting them, or watching replays.

I mean... PUBG even officially say they ban 100.000 acc PER WEEK haha....

"Never really had a problem with this after using Q and E for my 2.6k hrs best advice i could give is hit the range and practice hitting both buttons at same time, i pretty much put half my finger tip on E and Q and push A or D when needing to strafe.","Sounds very unconsistant, depending on hands and keyboard. I feel like I'd hit C(crouch) sometimes and cancel lean when I don't want to.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Well you are probably in the same boat as I was.

I couldnt lean with QE effectively, my fingers just couldnt learn to do it right. I always messed something while leaning. It was very uncomfortable for me. I went to mouse buttons, but this wasnt the solution. It always messes your aim, even if you think otherwise. You arent as crisp with your mouse. Swamping QE didnt do the trick for me either. So I started thinking how could I bind it differently. 

I went for LCTRL (left), SPACE (right). 1-2 days to get use to it. Binded jump to mouse side button. I never went back and how fucking reliefing that was. 

I can do everything now. Lean dance as I want. My aim isnt messed up. My fingers are free, I dont ever fail to hit the right buttons. 


You just lean left with little finger and right with thumb. 

Your other fingers can WSAD all day long while leaning. 

Your mouse aim isnt fucked because you dont need to hold/click additional button. 

As for jumping, took me 1-2 days to ""fix"" my muscle memory. I jump on mousd side button. It doesnt affect other games where you still jump on space.

Try it, you will thank me later.","Hi, I did something similar.

I made left shift lean left and space bar lean right. I use ctrl for crouch from CS. I made B = jump which I hit with my thumb - if I happen to hit space at the same time it leans while I jump, no biggie. I have sprint/walk bound to mouse. 

Always tweaking I recently changed crouch from toggle so it makes leaning left while crouching kinda weird but I haven’t decided what to do about that.

Anyway, just wanted to chime in.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
I have lean on V and B now in all games. Takes some getting used to but it's super easy to do quick lean peeks while strafing now.,"Same here, i've been using V and B for years now and it has become very comfortable and intuitive.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
">  It's almost impossible for me to: lean left, walk left,walk forward, then quickly shoot, unlean and walk back right behind the cover.

Why?

Literally useless. Balefrost is one of the best leaners in the world, he leans super fast, cancels it mid lean and still hits his targets. He doesn't do what you are asking for because it makes no sense to do that. You gain nothing from it. If you want to corner peek then just go to the corner and peek it. I don't get why you think you need to also incorporate walking forward and then walking back into the motion. You can definitely learn the motion after lots of practice, it's just a waste of your time. You could've used that time to actually learn something that would help you.

Just lean, walk to the side then lean the other direction(to hide yourself quicker) and walk to the side. No one will also walk forward and backward in the middle of that motion because it doesn't give you anything. You do that before/after doing the leaning, not while doing it.

Unless you want to be fancy and bind them to x/c/v/b/n/m(that will give you the most range of motion for moving whichever you want as you'd use your thumb for the leaning c,v,b are probably the most comfortable) then just switch Q for E and vice versa and now you can easily walk to the left while leaning left, and because you only switch them around it's really easy to rebuild your muscle memory. I got used to the new keybinds in less than a day.",">what you are asking for because it makes no sense to do that

it's not useless... Imagine that you're below a ridge and enemies are on top, I want to lean right, ADS, move forward and right at the same time. I don't want to move right, then forward, I want to go diagonally.

Like I said, leaning right is a bit easier since I move middle finger from W to E and still have finger on A to counter strafe behind cover but leaning left, my middle finger barelly sits on half of Q keycap and pushes my A finger to the left. I feel like many people with not-giant hands have problems with this.

I know it's possible but the fact that all my fingers have to constantly move around is annoying. If I press W E and D together then my A and Q buttons are not occupied and I feel like this will make me less agile.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Man i don't have many hours in the game i'm a noob so to speak. i remember i played without leaning cause I couldn't use it with qe too tough as I was coming from XBox controller. But I realized that I was at a great disadvantage by not leaning and after learning how to lean i feel this is def something missing from other games. I love it. i ll tell u how I lean.

I use my middle finger only to press Q/E and also W. I use index finger to press D. And now the trick :-) I use the other finger (don't know the name in English) for A/Caps Lock. That's right, I move left by pressing either Caps Lock or A and move right by pressing D! It worked like a charm for me! After that assignment I practiced all the time, like when I was in the lobby on training mode and what else. I'd sprint crouch go to a corner then lean then would stand up sprint again go to another corner and then lean again and repeat this until the match starts. It worked for me and today I lean. Now I'm trying to figure a way to do alternate aiming like leaning left/right constantly while shooting.

Moving left using both Caps Lock and A is what did the trick for me.

I hope this helps. (Honestly the pedals that other people suggested seem fair as well but i'm not sure if these are allowed in tournaments)

tc!","In addition, the idea of Caps Lock and A for moving left is like the A button is too close to Q making it hard at least for me to press it while leaning. So I made the A button longer so to speak by using the Caps Lock button. This makes for a longer A button which is much more comfortable to press at least for me.

And yes.. they are cheating. They try to balance the wins in ranked with low scores in normal Matches so that they don’t raise suspicion.

"Sometimes you have to pick your battles in this game is the simple answer. This game forces you to understand field advantage and understanding weather or not you have it, and it makes a huge difference. Just because you can see someone in the final circle it does not mean you should start a fire fight with that player. I see a lot players starting fire fights late game without thinking first and it normally comes back to bite them in the ass. People who win at this game often are not just better shots than you or me. They understand the battle field and how to out maneuver all other players in order to have the most field advantage. So next time your in the final circle and you see another player you want to engage maybe consider the following....

Do I have proper cover to see this fire fight thru to the end?

Do I have proper cover from other players who will inevitably notice my fire fight and try to third party me?

Can I move and gain better cover before engaging? (This is almost always the right answer btw)    

Can I move and take away someone else's cover in order to ambush them in a surprise attack?

These are the things one must start considering before engaging other players in this game. 

The better you get at making the right tactical decision the better your odds of winning your engagements.",I'm actually terrible relative to high level players in terms reflexes and aim but I compensate with top tier positioning and decision making. That's what I love about this game.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Hey, I think it's a combination of things. As you play more, your recoil control will improve. Movement like this is part of why ARs and DMRs are so popular, you can hit these people by firing a lot. If you practice, you should be able to drop people with auto sprays from your AR out to about 100m or so. The recoil bloom should help you hit people are dodging this way. As someone else said, waiting until they ADS is also good.","Okay thanks a lot for this, for a player like that do you tend to just kind of spray once at their body and then in a small circle around them hoping you'll sort of match their movement? Also do you tend to just stay away from full on snipers in the late game because of that and use a DMR instead?",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"As mentioned, it does really depend on the situation mate. Using a sniper is harder because you really rely on headshots which is going to be a moving target. If i notice they are bobbing around and i only have a sniper, generally I won't engage unless they are peeking or having moments standing still. If playing duos or squads you can also try and hit 2 sniper chest shots at once to get the knock.

 If your using a DMR i generally aim for the chest. I do practice alot in training using the dmr with no attachments and various scopes firing them quickly so you learn the recoil etc. I prefer to use no attachments because when in game if you pick up a compensator etc it will make the aiming easier for you.

If you don't already, Warm up in training for 10-15 mins before you start playing it really helps alot!","Thanks for this, both firing the sniper at once is actually a pretty neat idea haha, had never considered actually counting down to it like that. Cheers",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

Would you choose one out of the two, and also give some background on why did you choose that?",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"It's a tougher choice than I first thought as 60hz to 75hz isn't that great. I'd still go with the 1440p for the game just to get the clarity of picture and the fps is fine.  I've got a 144hz 1080p monitor but I still use my 75hz 1440p as 1080p looks bad now.

It also depends on how you play the game for me I'm not that good so I like it to look good.

You might be able to sqeeze a few extra frames out of it with Nvidia control panel.","Thanks, yes, it is indeed a tough question. I will give the Lenovo monitor a try, and see what do I feel different.

For the long run I will need to buy a 1440p 144hz monitor I think.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"I would use monitor 2. Don't even have to think about it that much.

- 60hz isn't that different from 75hz
- 1440p is a huge upgrade over 1080p. Game will be a lot clearer (easier to spot enemies in the distance)
- Game should easily run at a locked 60fps so you don't even need Freesync

"Actual tier list is:

S Tier: (never passed up, better at everything than every other weapon) 
Mk14. 

A Tier: (optimal in slot depending on player preference and availability) 
AUG, Groza, Beryl, M4, SLR, Mini (QBU), MG3 may go here. 

B Tier: (Viable if A Tier not available, at a strict disadvantage to A Tier but better in a narrow niche) 
M249, DP, SCAR (QBZ/G36), AK, Mutant, M16, M24, Kar/Mosin, AWM. 

C Tier: (Niche use, not generally viable) 
Pump, DBS, VSS, all pistols. 

D Tier: (used only in the absence of any other gun) 
Everything else.","Arguably VSS is B tier, but it's literally unusuable without an extended and it's extremely bad for drivebyes and punishing rotates. As a straight AR it's very good though, and very underrated.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"dbs godlike, okay.. where is the panzerfaust?","I think the issues people have with the DBS is that they're trying to play with it like it is an AR or SMG. It's crazy powerful when you're close, especially since it's not as punishing if you miss the first shot. The only downside is you are very reliant on the DMR you have to carry along with it, sometimes even on distances when you'd normally use an AR.

But when you meet a player that knows how to use it it's very scary. You basically can't push him, even with low HP he will likely have enough time to kill you if you get too close, unlike an AR.

Also you have almost no reason to ADS over hipfire, which makes you very mobile when using DBS. Which is another mistake people make with the DBS, they don't adjust their movements to the weapon.

Definitely a S tier weapon imo, it just requires vastly different playstyle to what most people are used to. Having one in a squad game is definitely viable. Shotgun shells are also very light and you don't need heaps of them, which also allows you to be the grenades mule for your squad.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"more like ""what i like to play with"" list",Not really. WJ's favorite weapon is the VSS which he has B tier. All you have to do is watch 1 pro game and you'll see his tier list in action.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
I mostly agree with this list. I would move the Tommy Gun up a tier or two. I'd move the Mini down to A tier. Crossbow down to C tier. Aug down to S tier. Otherwise it's good.,You have no clue what you are talking about. Move down the mini and the aug? haha ok mate.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"i can't figure out what guns are what from the low rez images

here is my list

C Tier - Mini, M16A, Vector, M249

D Tier - Ump45, S686, DP28, Tommy Gun

F Tier - sidearms + Micro Uzi (you will never change my mind the micro uzi is trash)",MP5 Mutant over M4? You drunk?,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"QBU in the S list... what?!

In my opinion the ranked system is bullshit rn. Why won't you get any points between - 15 and +15? It's completely broken and needs to be changed in the next season.,"this is the only thing that I find total bs. My friend gets +15 with 1 kill while I get -15 with zero kills from the same match. Kills totally should matter like they do but why didn't I get +13, instead I got -15. It's so fucking stupid. I am 99% sure it always rounds down since times I've got -15 are like triple to times I've got +15.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"I totally agree. I am currently diamond v ranked on PC FPP.

I can’t move past this tier. It doesn’t matter what I do. You consistently need to come top 5 and get a couple of kills to progress a little. But a couple of early knockouts outside of top 10.. and you drop a level very quickly. 

There in lies the problem.. it seems to matter just as much if you die early as it does if you win the game. 

The game doesn’t reward kills properly. It just doesn’t care much. I have won a game with one kill and it gives me 39 points. And I have won a game with 7 kills + 2 assists and it will give me 43 points.

No recoil is just a myth, it's not even a thing on pubg PC, more of a console cheat. People just think someone has no recoil because 1. the replay system looks fucked, you can't really judge anything off the replay system and 2. because good players can control the recoil, so they automatically think its a cheat when they're just good 🤷‍♀️",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"There's been a massive uptick in noticeable cheating the last couple weeks. Probably something to do with the warzone ban wave and increased popularity from PGIS. Just got killed by a guy with a 29.8KD. Look forward too seeing that ban notification in a couple minutes.   


This game is becoming increasingly less enjoyable to play every month. There will be a lull for about two weeks where there doesn't seem to be any cheaters. Then you get in a rut like I'm currently in and they're in every match. This might be the last rut I trudge through if it doesn't improve. The weirdest part is WHEN I've been noticing these cheaters.

"Depends on your budget.

I haven’t played anything other than PUBG.
These are US prices
I play anti alias and texture at fine to ultra.  Everything else to low to medium.
I play at 1080p because I’m using an old monitor.
Average FPS is 160-250.

Ryzen 5 3600 $200
Msi b450. $85
16gb ram $90
500gb ssd $80
Msi gtx 1660 super $260
Corsair psu 650w $90
Case $90
Some extra fans $40

That’s $935.   You’ll still need a monitor and I also have an extra sdd. (Extra ssd not needed)  One runs windows and the other runs my games.  You can cut some costs.  And I’ve seen some impressive cheaper builds.   But don’t cut costs (buy shit brands) when it comes to your power supply, ram and motherboard.


I’m not oppose to prebuilt if it gets you gaming and you’re happy.  But building your own is easy and IMO has a longer life span due to being able swap parts as you go.

Many of my parts are from an old build from ten years ago.  So this year I’ll I had to do is buy a cpu, mother board, gpu and ram.   Yes the big stuff but my previous cpu was old from 2012.  Also got the ssd as a Xmas gift last year giving me my second ssd .  So I was able to save a few hundred using old parts.

There’s a ton of YouTube videos.   The main challenge is picking a budget and sticking to it.   It’s very easy to over spend.  And if you can afford it awesome.

Hope that helps.

Btw I spent two years on PUBG mobile and still love it.   But once you go PC you won’t go back.","1660 super is overkill especially with the current prices of GPUs. Good luck finding the card for the price you listed it at. It's literally being sold for twice as much.

"some straight-to-the-point suggestions:

* don't go for used systems or components. unless you want to end up with parts that fail after a year or so, maybe even less. if its a first-time system, always go new. and go pre-built unless you want the headache of trying to put together a system when you know nothing about pc components. 
* go for something high end if at all possible. the better the system you buy, the longer it will last and the happier you'll be when you're able to run literally any game you throw at it. a pc is a big investment but it's worth it for the amount of time, fun and utility it will provide. like a new car for example
* cyberpunk to me felt like a huge waste of money. even after the recent updates its still borderline broken and runs like shit even on my new machine i bought this year. wait til its on sale somewhere if you really want it. 

i used to always build my own system but most recently bought a prebuilt setup from [ebuyer.com](https://ebuyer.com), one of their alphasync desktops. i didn't have the money upfront either but was well overdue a new system and also wanted it mostly to run pubg. my old system was comprised of mostly 5-6+ year old components and struggled to play pubg smoothly. 

i bit the bullet & took out an interest-free-for-12 months credit card with my bank to buy a £1200 rig. i've put the card away somewhere and dont plan on touching it again until i've paid off the pc which works out at £70 a month to pay off within the interest-free period. if you can manage your money well this or any finance based method might be an option worth considering.

good luck!","Good advice, thank you. I will definitely try and keep all that in mind as i decide on what direction to go",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

People aren't gonna like this but you don't need to be an all pro to have good games and you don't need to calculate the stats of guns. I have about 800 hours since launch and a 15% win rate so take that as you will. The best gun is the one you get used to using and are able to land successful hits with. People moan about micro stats that make a difference on a macro level but the vast majority of the time the person who wins a fight does so because they land their shots.

This is so true. I played a lot around release and a year forward, put hundreds of hours in. Not that ranked/stats mattered that much back then but I regularly placed in the top 0.5% of my region. 

Then I stopped and only recently picked it up again. Man, I suck. Like, can barely hit the side of a barn suck. Aim, game sense, loot speed, I am just so much worse. Also the overall skill level of players has definitely increased since. Back in my day people were content picking a house and camping there.

I’m have zero doubt that if I didn’t go for the res and took the fight we win that game. But that’s PUBG. A single mistake costs you. Squads gives you a little bit of leeway as your friends can dig you out. But solos is rough. 

I haven’t won a solo game in ages (I don’t play much) but it feels completely different to squads. I suggest you play squads more, find some regular friends to play with.

"The players who blindly rush out of cover to finish a kill off then instantly die to the knocked player's team mates are frustrating to play against, because they are morons.

Theyre not even doing it to cause grief, but trying to seem legit and get stats....wtf man.","Notice how a lot of the cheaters that get banned seem to have names that sound like they're from a certain country? In that country, cheating (on exams, on interviews, on contracts, etc.) isn't seen as a bad thing but rather something that would be stupid to not take advantage of in order to excel. That mentality spills over into games and the rest of the world suffers for it, hence the years and years of people begging for a region lock. Hell, there was even an incident of cheaters in a live event against other countries... it's insane. The main defense against these cheaters infecting the games of the rest of the world is still region locking and hardware bans, but Bunghole will never do that because of $$$.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

A broken shadow? This is where you draw the line?,"It’s not a broken shadow. The image is just one example of the mess the new lighting and shadow effects are causing. When I walk through a room, the shadows flicker between on and off. The shadow also moves around me in the way one experiences when an airdrop is falling above you and casts a moving flickering shadow over your shoulder. 

In summary. It is currently broken after latest update.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Could you explain what's happening here in more detail?,"Since the latest update. The shadow effects in houses with lights.. causes a swirling effect that is not normal to how light reflects. It’s very distracting and as you run through the rooms, you keep seeing a moving shadow over your shoulder. Like as if an airdrop is in the air. 

The shadow effect here is even more broken it spins around in the room. 

Everything was fine before the update for me.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Not everyone plays this game for it to be an action fest,That's the reason PUBG is losing players. People get bored. We need new players.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Maybe. I dont necessarily want it to be that way always.

But I think circle behaviors could be used to create variation in games. Some games might have high blue damage and circle sizes based on player counts. Maybe set it so the first circle is small and blue is fast but you know aforetime where the first circle will be. 

Seems the kind of thing that could pop up in unranked games occassionally.", Changing the circle size based on number of players is a great idea,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Sanhok has always done this and it's great. It's a problem on bigger maps, however, and would only increase center dropping since you got fucked by a one minute rotation last time you dropped Oasis or Alcantara.",I think it's a fair trade off.. if you land far away.. you don't have to fight before you loot but you have to quickly move in if you see the number of alive players going down.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS

So i am usually very thankful for some free loot goblins",yea until you decide to sneak up on another team only to have a bot shoot at you from fucking nowhere blowing up your cover.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Why did you not make strong/weak/balanced options for every category? If your questions are biased the results will be meaningless.,"I thought about it but if anyone actually thinks SMGs are too weak they're too stupid to participate in this poll and their data would just clutter up everything. They're better by every metric, easier to control and faster TTK, lighter ammo, more limb damage, etc. etc.

I think any data from people who think that would be irrelevant, because it would be from people who either don't know the game very well or are too bad at the game to understand the weapon balance.

"WhoCrashed can be useful in diagnosing this kind of thing.

[https://www.resplendence.com/whocrashed](https://www.resplendence.com/whocrashed)",I'm going to try this right now,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Because you've re-installed, and I don't hear about this as a common thing, I'd try and test+prove that it doesn't happen in outside of PUBG. You might be right, and this might very well be PUBG... but this is still a good to test, regardless.

Sometimes when hardware is under a specific type of load, weird things can happen. Maybe a specific component is overheating, and you need to adjust fan behavior. If your CPU or GPU is running super hot (or has been running hot for years), they might be towards the end of their life. Also, your PSU may be failing... google says it's a model from 2014, which shouldn't be terrible, but would explain the complete restart behavior.

To test, see if you can re-create the issue with other system stress tests, outside of PUBG (like AIDA64 or Prime95). Run whatever else you usually have running & active (ie your headset+mic, etc). If you can get it to restart under a benchmark or system stress test, you know it's not a problem with PUBG, and with one of your components.

If it's your PSU, you just need a new one, unfortunately. Your CPU and your GPU are a little more flexible; Lots of tools out there will let you mess with how they behave to get them to chill out a bit (adjusting voltages & boost behavior). Good luck dude.","That’s the thing, I’ve run stress tests like the ones you mentioned and couldn’t recreate it.

One friend completely reinstalled everything nvidia, it fixed his but not mine. I completely reinstalled pubg it didn’t fix it. So I completely reinstalled nvidia, still didn’t fix it. Now I’m reinstalling pubg again thinking maybe I missed a %temp% file somewhere when deleting... besides that I am really just confused. The tests put my pc under higher loads than what my pc ever gets to when even playing pubg.

I’ve even when into my power settings and turned off restarting. Everything game dvr is off too. 

Tried overclocks on. Overclocks off. Nothing seems to matter. If it were my psu, why aren’t other games being effected? I can play cod or bf all day, no issues.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"No matter what, yes there is a steep learning curve. However, the addition of bots is an incredibly friendly bridge between new players and regulars. With them you will have plenty of opportunities to practice and get kills instead of getting wrecked in your first encounter every match.

Don’t worry I’m sure the community will let them know we don’t want no wall building...,and then they do it anyway?,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"It honestly really depends on what ""building"" entails and how they implement it. I'm only gonna talk about building as I don't like the idea of traps. Even if they are ""balanced"" they just don't belong and just ruin the game flow.

If it's something ridiculous like fortnite, then it obviously has no place in the game(though I can't lie I kinda want to try it just for the lulz). If it was a one time special game mode I'd definitely try it. It sounds too troll not to try it. If anything I'd much rather play PUBG fortnite than actual fortnite. It fixes almost everything I don't like about fortnite - 3rd person and RNG shooting.

If building isn't like fortnite but something like battlefield where you can dig a hole and fortify it with sandbags then that might not be that bad. It can make late game more suspenseful and fair because you wouldn't get completely fucked by a zone shift where you have to play on flat ground.

That being said this can also break the game. It's one thing to have 1-2 ditches but what if every team makes one and the game from now on is ditch fights? I don't have any confidence that bluehole can come up with a solution that only improves the gameplay and has no game breaking negative effects. The only way I'd be okay with them adding such building is if it's only available on a single map. If they make a new 8x8 map and this is the gimmick the map has. That's when it wouldn't be that annoying if you have a lot of ditch fights, because it would only be true for this map. And this could shake up the gameplay and improve the game as a whole it as we'd have to adapt to the maps, just like you need to adapt from erangel to miramar because they play out completely differently.","Perfectly agree with the sandbags and ditches idea you had, and the downsides of it, but then PUBG would need more wallbangable surfaces, and well a whole rework on the system. The curent game is designed to not be destroyed, and just destroyig stuff on karkan will drop my frames by 10 0r so, and that is just tiny walls",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"The fact that they are even considering ""wall build"" shows you all you need to know about the devs for this game.","Yep. Sadly, the devs kinda just gave up.

Where's the survey?,"The news pop up, it's i the top right corner of the client",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"IDK about new features like this, shit like the C4 and glider, panzerfaust etc. all don't really change gameplay, they sorta just ruin it TBH. Gliders just literally fly in circles shooting at you, and there's nothing you can do about it because you can't take the time to find the lead on before they start hitting you. And it's literally always some dogshit streamer doing it hoping to hit a shot from a glider. 

I'd rather just a Mirimar remaster (which I think is coming) and a big map/small map queue or something. This would actually improve the game. having to sit through bad maps for 55 mins hoping to get Erangel or Mirimar when you only have like 2 hours to play is annoying and honestly just wears you down over time.","I reckon the glider and C4 were both great additions, myself. Dunno about the Panzerfaust, as I don't play the maps where it spawns.

I'm worried about some of the things suggested by the survey, but I think there are some good, more reasonable ideas in this thread -- more functional doors and door opening, tripwires that set off flashes rather than explosions, etc, and hopefully the devs are paying attention.

That said, Fortnite-style (or let's face it, RUST-style, because that's what's hot right now and for sure where this idea came from, I reckon) building would almost certainly ruin the core gameplay.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"I played since 2016 and remember the patch that included the world ping ""Apex Style"" and honestly never understood the dislike for it. I think it would make it easier to communicate with my random team.","Apex has much more fast and agile player movement and gameplay.

train your mouse control,"You might be right, I may need to train it more. Are you also using a superlight mouse for PUBG? I'm starting to think it's only good for fast paced games that don't require heavy precision, like I can use my Viper Ultimate 70g and my Zowie EC2 90g, SteelSeries Rival 310 88g for CSGO and PUBG but when it comes to my Xtrfy M42 60g, I can tap fire and spray well in CSGO but when it comes to PUBG, where a tap fire means your crosshair will go up super high, it's almost impossible to control it even tapping slowly, what more if I fast tap fire it, which I easily do with the other mice. I'm not sure but maybe, a mouse can be too light for certain games like PUBG where you have to aim and correct your crosshair, shooting a running target over 300m away, I'm not sure though if anyone else is having this problem",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"I have the Superlight and have no problems with aiming. 

800 dpi - ~40-43 sens in game (from my memory). 

Whats your DPI, sens and mousepad?","You have a high sens =D. I have low sens of 400 DPI, 45 sens in PUBG, that's like 400 DPI at 2 sens in CSGO and I'm using SteelSeries QCK Heavy cloth mouse pad. Maybe it also have something to do with the fact that I went from big and heavy mouse like Zowie EC2B, Viper Ultimate and SteelSeries Rival 310 to a really small ultralight weight mouse like the Xtrfy M42 which is a big as the Viper Mini, or maybe too light could also be a thing for certain games, I'm not sure anymore but I do like the ultralight weight it is less fatiguing. I should have probably tried the G Pro Superlight instead for my first ultralight mouse, unfortunately its still sold out everywhere",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Having trouble feeling the mouse eye control with a light mouse maybe? Hey if the heavier ones feel better for you I say just go with that.,Do you personally use an ultralight mouse for a game like PUBG?,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Your sens might be too high? Lighter mouse takes less effort to micro adjust, so if your sens is higher and you ""flinch"" your hand slightly when you tap fire, you might end up micro adjusting by accident, if that makes sense. Try lower sense maybe.

I've personally noticed recoil and sprays are easier with heavier mice.","I think my sens is low enough at 400 dpi and 45 sens in game. I even tested to try a super low sens sens of like 25 just to see if it would help but its the same effect, when I shoot at a wall in training mode, the long range sight goes up and its difficult to put it back to where I initially shot. So if that alone is hard for me, then it would be impossible to fast tap fire people running far away. When I went back to my other mouse around 70-90g, I could easily shoot at one spot and keep it there, tapping, fast with a long range scope. Maybe I need to train more with the light mouse or maybe, too light for certain games could be a thing too, I'm not sure I'm new to ultra light weight mice. And yes, I think its easier to control recoil and sprays both long and close distance with heavier mice too. In CSGO though, in deathmatch, its so easy to move around and tap heads with the lighter mouse because the tap fire recoil there is not as drastic as PUBG.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"I've been having this same issue. My crosshair placement speed and awareness went up by going light. It took me a long while to readjust sprays on it. But to this day when I go back to a heavier mouse dmrs feel instantly natural to shoot accurately.

 I lowered my scope sens even more which has helped a lot (I didn't realise I had to lower it by as much as 5 until I got rid of accidental micro bumps). 

But what I think is happening is there is just less 'mouse' overall to throw around so it's harder to judge to recorrections since you aren't grabbing this big stable brick and the weight holding you steady anymore, it's more directly from your hand. Grip is also important. My grip is way better on the zowie ZA12 so my accuracy is more consistent but it hurts my wrists and hand due to weight, therefore making me less accurate later anyway. The MM710 just allows me to do much more despite a much worse shape so I think sticking with the light weight is just better.

The thats my two cents anyway.","Thank god I’m not the only one, it feel it’s so easy to point and shoot with the light mouse but then when I have to use DMR, I cant control it for shit Lol. I go back to medium weight and bigger mouse, then I can just speed tap people over 300M, yeah I think you’re right that there’s more mouse, usually ultralight mouse is smaller but I should probably try the other ultralight that are just as big as my previous mice to really see the difference because with this small and light mouse, even if I experimentally lower my sens by a whole lot, it’s the same effect and it’s just so hard to pull down and readjust to the same target",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Mice are personal preference stop worrying about it and just use what you like,"Depends on what you want to do with your gaming.


Option A:

If you just play casually, that advice is entirely correct. Just make sure you are as comfortable as possible. You don't need to change any key binds or equipment and force yourself to adapt to them, because at the end of the day it's all about chilling and being as comfortable as possible. It's not about trying to be the next shroud or trying to reach challenger. If you are reading this and this describes you and your goal with gaming then this is as far as you need to read this comment. Everything else wouldn't concern you and it would go against everything you strive for in gaming, so it would be a waste of time for you.

---

Option B:

If however you want to squeeze every possible angle to get as much performance as possible, then you need to optimize everything you can, and that includes mice. What is most comfortable doesn't mean it's also most optimal. Objectively a lighter mouse is better if you can adapt to it. Same goes for higher sens. If you could have 100% precision higher sens will always objectively be better than lower sens because it allows for faster movements. However that isn't humanly possible which is why most pro players use slow sens. 

That being said there are a number of people who have dedicated their time to adapting to fast sens and are top of their games. Long gone are the days where people tell you ""just lower your sens, it will make you play better"". It is a personal preference and it's one that will be decided by you, because you can force a sensitivity on yourself and learn it. Why would you force a sensitivity? Because different sensitivities provide different advantages. Low sens is usually better for accuracy and long range shooting. However it suffers from being really bad at clearing buildings because you don't turn fast enough. It also has a limitation of the scopes you could use and the range you can spray at. Faster sens is the opposite. Usually you'd see worse accuracy but faster reactions, great building clearing, harder to be precise in long range DMR fights. 

It's worth to note that only 1 of them has the option of improving on the negatives. With slow sens even if you swipe your mouse pad and can turn corners to clear corners, it would always be significantly slower than a fast sens user. You could spray even with a 6x beryl with extreme low sens but you are limited in how far the spray could take place and how many bullets you can fire before you are limited by outside factors(your mouse pad). No matter how much you train you'd never be able to accurately spray more bullets than what your mouse pad has space for. However slower sens is easier to get good at and easier to stay consistent which is why majority of the players pick that, even if on paper it is inferior. That's why people would still recommend slower sens. It's easier to get into and most people wouldn't dedicate 8-10 hours a day trying to perfect higher sens. For 9.9/10 people recommending slower sens would yield them better results. Exactly how slow is entirely up to preference.

 There isn't a magic number that makes everyone shoot better at. So sens is indeed preference and you should try different shit before you hit something you like or you should force a sens depending on how you want to play. If you want to be really aggro and 3x/4x spray even up to 100m then a higher sens would fit that more. It wouldn't make any sens to just stick with what's comfortable when it doesn't fit how you want to play the game. You should always keep in mind that if you want to change your playstyle or if you just want to try different, you can always do that. Tenz(one of the most mechanical valorant players) sometimes switches his sens in between tournament matches.

 Muscle memory as presented by most people on the internet is all but a myth/lie. Your brain can adapt and change it's muscle memory to fit your new sens. It would take time but you will adjust and if you decide you want to go back to your old sens you can do that with ease. Everyone who is telling you that you are ""going to fuck up your muscle memory if you do that"" is a fucking retard. If they suddenly decided to change how much basketballs weigh and then change it back a season later, you wouldn't see Curry magically missing everything. Even though he has trained with the same ball for his whole life, he wouldn't have any problem adapting to the new weight and then doing the same when it's back to the original. He wouldn't have ""fucked his muscle memory"" because he played a year with a different ball. Just like you won't fuck up your muscle memory if you switch your sens for a week/month to test it out. So if you've always been wondering if you could be better with X sens, then just try it, you have nothing to lose. If it doesn't work out you can always go back. And if anything you'd actually improve. It has been proven that changing your sens and then changing it back to your original one, is a good form of practice because your brain notices that there is a difference in what should be routine work and instead of being on auto pilot and only relying on muscle memory, it is working very hard to find out what is ""wrong"" and correct it. Thus you improving faster because you aren't just mindlessly on auto pilot. The same proccess is activated once again when you go back to your original sens, and it's a tool some people use to get out of plateaus. It's very common in the aim/kovaaks community.

It definitely is worth it to see how much you can push your own limit and find a good balance in sensitivity and mouse weight, if you want to be as competitive as possible. Every mouse is different which is why you'd likely need to change your sensitivity, not just the mouse. It's quite common for people that buy lightweight mouse or simply a faster mouse pad to lower their sens to ""match"" what they had before. There's a reason everyone and their mother is rocking lightweight mice nowadays, while very few pro players are still refusing to change their 100g monsters. It is objectively better if you can adapt to it. And it shouldn't even be that hard to adapt to it, our brains are insanely powerful. However if you always have the ""I can't hit shots because my mouse is too light"" in the back of your head, then you will never adapt to it, so might as well just change back to what you are comfortable. 

There's a reason why placebo can work even if it's technically useless. The mind is a really powerful tool and if you are convinced a light mouse makes you play worse then it will indeed make you play worse. It's all about letting yourself fail and trusting the proccess. If you accept that you'd suck before you fully grow into your new mouse and get back to the level you were before. Then you will eventually do it. For someone it might take a few days, for another it might be a month, for another it might be years. Everyone adapts/learns at different rates. If deep down you agree with the fact that a 60g mouse is better than a 90g mouse, then you'd inevitably adapt into it because there wouldn't be anything to kneecap your progress.

What people mean when they say ""mice are personal preference"" is the mouse size, shape and it's almost entirely because of your hand size and grip. Weight isn't one of those metrics because there is a clear answer that applies to everyone regardless of hand size or grip technique. You'd always want a lighter mouse if you wanted to be as competitive as you could be. Maybe there is a cut off where the mice do indeed become too light where it no longer is objectively better, but we haven't arrived at that cutoff yet(if such a cutoff even exists).",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

"Here we go. I believe lag compensation helps players with high pings in two areas, 1 they are harder to hit when moving and 2 they are slightly faster in short-range combat. When I say I higher ping I mean, 150-250 NOT 500.  At 500 your ping is so bad it affects your gameplay regardless of lag comp or not. In my testing(which is not scientific, just me using a VPN to Europe, Mexico) My ping goes to 170-200 and I do better.   I stop missing many of the mid to longs shots I normally miss while playing in the US with a 70 ping. One of the observations from watching a lot of replay videos is when my weapon is fired at A MOVING target at mid to long we see the normal recoil BUT the bullet does not leave the gun until were almost at the top of the recoil.  So, what I am saying is that I get recoil before the bullet leaves the weapon.   The second more common issue is that my bullet is not traveling at the correct speed.  This has a huge effect on hitting move players  This is just my experience and I know there have been discussions on this topic before and it's been a back and forth. BUT, those discussions have focused on ""peekers advantage"" not the issues I'm experiencing.  Whacky Jacky made a video about it and then took it down. Battle Non-Sense make a very detailed video about it and his conclusion was that there was no Lag-compensation or did not affect gameplay.

"Technically yes, in reality - no.

Unless they removed it and didn't say anything about it there technically should still be matchmaking but because there are very few people playing compared to the early days, it's literally nonexistent in any region not named China.

I see you asking for source, I don't know why you even need that as it doesn't change anything, but they did confirm it back in 2017/2018 so look for old threads and interviews if you wanna find it that bad. Once again I don't know why you need this useless info as it doesn't change anything for you, but you do you I guess. 

Anyone who has played before knows that the first few games of a season were basically free wins because it was still calibrating MMR after the reset, however with numbers dropping by 90% it might as well not even exist as it wouldn't change anything in your matches. The only visible difference that you'll see is that new accounts play against way more bots, and after some good play time it normalizes to ~20 bots, if your region has enough players to support the max number of real players per game which is 80.

tl;dr Both normal and ranked technically have SBMM but a very light one. It was visibly felt when a new season started back in the day, but with majority of the player base leaving, it is basically as if there is no SBMM in every region except CN.","Ive never heard that there was ever an MMR system implemented before the survival rank one was introduced, where WackyJacky showed that there indeed was a very slight bit of SBMM. But i have played the game for a long time now, always been curious about this sorta thing, and never have i heard any official, or anyone claiming they have any official statements about SBMM",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Ranked is a joke on NA of course there's no skill based matchmaking when there's already a limited player count queuing up.,I am curious about if its even in the code or not,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Simple answer - No, at least for EU hence my love-hate relationship with ranked. Maybe one day because now I feel like it would take ages to get a game with it which sucks. I suggest you to stick with normal games unless you're really good (like I'd say I'm very good but no match for Pro players with 6k+ hours)","Im not new to the game, i play it competitively and play some ranked. I personally love ranked. But i was wondering if the code is even there? For sbmm i mean. I am aware that you basically get none anyways, but does it even try?",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Depends on  your region, in NA there are barely enough player for pubs so ranked certainly is one pool of people when it does pop. EU likely has zero match making as well, asia is likely the only region that actually has any sort of SBMM in ranked.

I'm willing to bet that some regions or profiles are getting Miramar more than others - presumably some kind of bug in the randomisation code.

I really wish they'd reduce it or take it out of circulation. You can see people leaving the lobby for this map.

"But level 500 players aren't even good. It just means they've played a lot of hours. Doesn't change the fact that most of them are still pretty bad at the game.

League had an urgot stuck in bronze after 5k games. Just because you have a lot of experience, doesn't mean you are bound to be godlike at the game.

Survival level is literally meaningless. If anything 99% of the good players I've encountered were 100-300 level. They are the better than average PUBG players that took a long break from the game and played tarkov/apex or some other shit and just come back to play PUBG again and are destroying the lvl 500 ""veterans"" who still can't hit 200 adr even though there's bots in the game.

There's literally 0 correlation between survival level and skill. There are far more bad lvl 500 players than there are good.

All I'm saying is practice, practice, practice. Stop looking for excuses. If you are constantly getting shit on, then it isn't because you are playing against lvl 500 people. My friend and I were dropping 20+ kill wins on paramo when he just got back into PUBG after a year of not playing it, and we being lvl 100 and under. We then made another friend come back to PUBG and after leveling up his account to 80 we played 3 man ranked. Multiple 20+ kill wins there as well. And no, we aren't lvl 15 on Faceit or pro FPS players. We barely manage to hold 250-300 ADR. We are far from being at the top of PUBG. It's all about positioning, strats and trying to improve instead of whining and looking for excuses. All you need to be is better than the average and you'd win quite often. You don't need to be a 600+ ADR human prototype. You just need to be decent and be levelheaded.



P.S. a little bit redundant and stupid to make such a post and then say that you've won game and are over 500. Not only that but the only way to see that another sub lvl 500 won is if you die to them and finish 2nd. Or are you telling me you sit back and watch every single game to see who wins? It's not that hard to become lvl 500, most people are level 500 so it's statistically logical to see majority of the winners be lvl 500. That doesn't mean you are good just because you are level 500. 9/10 times when I get absolutely bodied it's a lower level account. Be it smurfs or just people coming back to the game, I just don't have any extra respect for lvl 500 players because I've seen time and time again how bad most are rotating and shooting. I really don't get why people coming back to the game are intimidated by it. Just practice a bit and chances are you'd be able to at least go even with them. We are talking about people who played for 3 years and are still struggling to hit 200 ADR or win more than 1% of their matches. Why are you intimidated by that?",Thanks for the great info!! Yes i now slowly understand that level has nothing to do with success but diligence keep pushing understanding map awareness....guns to use.....strategy and communication with team mates....im getting better...we’ve been consistently coming in 2nd though i just gotta be more aggressive at the end...but thank you,PUBATTLEGROUNDS

Thank you for this. Though you said teams highlighted in red squares are the only ones advancing to the weekly final so to only vote for those. Yet Faze should technically advance since they are listed under match 16 of the “weekly series” tab and they are not highlighted red?? Is this a bug or is Faze actually not going into the weekly final?,There is a little ** at the bottom of the UI page by PUBG stating “teams will be finalized by xx date” so there could be a delay in their part. I certainly don’t want to advise people to vote on a team that isn’t yet confirmed though lol,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"1. Shooting to kill removes a team, thus making it easier for you to win. But kills don't matter so yes teams are less aggressive.

2. Yes but alot of teams earned their win during this weeks games. It wasn't all just circle favored teams winning.

3.The majority of that weeks money goes to the first winning teams, then it decreases over wins I think.

4. We'll still see tons of the best teams playing, I'm sure Soniqs is glad to be kicking ass.

5. Weekly finals are where the money is to be made for the overall tourny, the team with the most money wins the entire PGI.S. Think of it as it's own little weekend final, every week. I think at least. 

6. Yea kind of. I saw someone mention that in all the simulations, the team that won the last week of games drastically had a higher % of winning the entire thing. It was done so that there is still a reason to watch final week, and route for your team, normally you'd see a team already so far ahead in the leaderboards that the event is over before the last weekend. 

I think Asian teams will find their way shortly, Kia was dominating ranking matches. China does seem to be struggling hard though.

Although PGI.S is kind of a botched way of determining who is the best, don't think of PGI.S as a championship, think of it as an entertainment event. It's not really to show who is the best in the world, rather provide entertainment. and IMO watching so far has been some of the most enjoyment I've had in PUBG esports, every win matters in the weekly survival, and waiting for GenG to get a win was super exciting.","Yeh, I get that killing someone will eliminate them from the game, but, the impact of the format here means that the games all end in a Mexican stand off... every time.

">PP only unless the mode is actually designed for TPP like Fantasy Royale was.

Also fantasy royale better fucking come back this year, it was the  most fun pupg experience I have had since.. ever I guess. Despite it being a joke mode it was balanced judging how hilariously unbalanced shitfest it could have been.","Yeah I missed out on that because I was busy with work at the time, but I watched people play and it looked like a ton of fun. I'd love to give it a shot it looks like exactly the kind of silliness I would enjoy.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Sorry, but do you have stats to back up your claim that majority of NA and EU players prefer FPP?

[https://pubgmap.io/telemetry/perspectives](https://pubgmap.io/telemetry/perspectives)

As you can see 71% of players in NA play TPP, whilst in EU, FPP just edged TPP slightly at 51%. I can understand your frustration as I myself prefer FPP but it's just a casual event so it shouldn't be an issue even if it's TPP. However, I'm all for PUBG to get rid of TPP Ranked so that FPP Ranked can be the focus for competitive gaming.","that page is so outdated that you can see that doesn't even have vikendi and karakin stats on it. there was a telemetry v2 version with updated stats but it's down since like 6 months ago. majority of players on NA players fpp, said by one of the pubg developers itself, but the difference it's not that much. in case of EU and SA, the difference is noticeable towards fpp",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"I feel like this debate could go on forever. I can tell that I enjoy both modes:   


* TPP is nice because I can enjoy the game more as a thriller as the third-person perspective gives me more context on what to do and when things are coming. It creates a better sense of adventure. Although you may have an advantage hiding behind objectives, I find this rarely the deciding factor when I play TPP. To me, the information I get from getting more context without peeking makes the game more thrilling.
* First-person is ideal when I want to have a more e-sports feeling to the game. Here you have no feeling of unfairness to the game because someone camped behind a wall and punished you for having the guts to push up on them.

Both game modes are equally enjoyable; they depend on what you want to get out of the game. 

&#x200B;

Tldr; TPP is still massively popular because it is more in line with what PUBG really is – a battle royale thriller that is not as much about looting and shooting but more about how you move, when you decide to engage or not, and of course, pure zone luck. 

People may not want to accept it but PUBG can't be compared to COD Warzen or Apex just because it carries the genre ""battle royale"". It is fundamentally different from classic BR games. And the TPP mode is still what works best with the game.","lmao, I chuckled",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Don't start the debate tpp vs fpp again....,This is not a TPP v FPP debate though.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"because tpp is still more popular, end of discussion.","But is it really more popular in NA and EU anymore? The recent removal of TPP Duo in NA and temporal removal of TPP Duo in EU seems to tell othervice. TPP is more popular overall sure, since most of the plaer base is in the asia that prefers TPP.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"well, solo ranked is dying (in part due to the royally fucked over point system)... last season you could start playing at 11am, then 1pm later that season, this season it's between 4-11pm. it's the sad truth, the moment i can't play solo ranked anymore, i will just uninstall the game, since normal solos are so god damn boring with that shitty loot and awful bots+ low skilled enemys.","Why do you think that the point system is royally fucked?

"4000 hours here. playing since 2017. game is in a good state performance wise but it's very stale in terms of content. it's been several patches since the last relevant thing they added into the game. all they did is to add gimmicks and functions nobody asked for, and while some of them might be kinda ok, it fails to fill the void the game has right now.","It is like this usually. One patch is big, following two are minor",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"I played PUBG heavily when it first released, until 900+ hours or so until I got fed up. The game didn't see enough updates, and PUBG devs focused on mobile and e-sports with an unfinished game. That drove me away from it.

After a while of playing Apex, I returned to PUBG because I like the slower, more strategic style of play. Here are a few thoughts in neat bullet points:

**The Good**

* The game runs great now
* Vikendi and Erangel are still the very very good maps
* I would agree that cheaters are at an all-time low
* Weapons are balanced, and mechanics feel great
* PUBG has a continually rising tension, which is great
* Games are high stakes; little mistakes are sometimes punished hard

**The Bad**

* Map selection is minimal
* The cosmetic item shop is a joke; costly and generally items with little to no appeal
* Bots are weird; they don't pose a real threat, and sometimes it feels like they make up 40% of the players on any given server
* The game feels abandoned and somewhat unipersonal; very eery feeling playing PUBG all by yourself

**The Ugly**

* I don't think the game is going anywhere
* Many of my former mates refuse to get back into the game because they were let down as PUBG devs didn't focus on the core player base for a long time
* Servers are thinning

I think overall, it is sad to see PUBG go out of fashion. In my opinion, no other battle royale gave me the adrenaline rush and sense of accomplishment when winning a game. PUBG has always been more of a thriller than a shooter. I loved that about the game. Unfortunately, it has not listened to the players all that much and made some very questionable choices along the way. 

&#x200B;

Tldr; game with great potential; developers couldn't deliver on the potential",">PUBG devs focused on mobile

"3,5k hours, started in pre 1.0 in 2017. 

I love the game, however now it is super stale. I wish we had more content or features that would refresh the game. Something along the lines: 

* real new guns that are not irrelevant 90% time or useless (aka scorpion / dbs / rare crate guns)

* changing gun ballance from time to time to keep things fresh

* all guns on all maps OR some kind of rotation (QBU Miramar, MPK5 Erangel why not?)

* more content / more ideas 

* have the balls to add something fun or challenging that won't break the game ballance.

If you ask me people making major decisions are at fault. Devs are not making decisions of what will be implemented, or when or even in what direction the game will go. If we do look at some things like vaulting, it was implemented really well especially considering how it was done( later down the line). You can hate on the vehicle mechanics all you want( not you personally) but it's still one of the best out there (where driving is not the main/only point of the game) network performance was improved from horrible to second best ( yes better then cod,apex and everything else asside from Fortnite) ballistics are amazing, gunplay is top tier.

"I'm disappointed by every single patch to be honest in the last months (years..?). 

I can't recall when last time when I was excited for a patch that goes live. Everything feels so half-done-meh-no one wants that.

I feel like this game is half abandoned. 

I still love it, but content wise - there is nothing. Skins, new vehicle(s), new stuff that no one uses or is completely irrelevant. 

I remember BIG FAT PATCHES that made me so excited for the game. 


**Back in the day we got new guns (now we get guns that are meme /scorpion, dbs etc.), new weapon ballance, new scopes, great QoL improvements, UI improvements, new mechanics (do you remember you couldn't move while heal/boost?), vault system, new items, attachments, tons of good stuff.**


Now it's all about skins and a cheap pass (so skins again). 

Here and there they will throw in a car or something, or features like radio in car or team emotes. That's hardly exciting whatsoever. 

Every patch is so god damn underwhelming. 

Even the new season patches are so weak now ;-C.","to be fair we got the long asked for performance improvements tho. i cant remember the game doing any better performance wise before.  


whats badly missing is a proper miramar remake and a improved (slightly faster/more responsive!) movement system.  


but yes, we didnt get any big content since erangel 2.0 and ledge grab. the vikendi update was more like a fine tuning than a big update in my eyes.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"""Team Emotes"" does spontaneously just feel like a way to get full squads to purchase the same emotes, thus selling more.

I think it's just busted (which would be better than a freakin' change to 6 minute wait times).",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"This update is smooth and awesome. It feels like the magic backend wizardry going on behind the scenes feels stronger than ever, keeping the fights and action as intense and gripping as it can be. The quality of life updates feel phenomenal and I think a lot of players can tell right away that the game is putting out a few more frames and processing everything smoothly and efficiently. Awesome job guys","I have a 3.5 year old gaming laptop with a Nvidia 960M and I7-6700 and 12 GB of RAM. 

When I first installed PUBG when it was first released on Steam, it was absolutely unplayable. 10-20 FPS and horrible graphics. Couldn’t even drop anywhere near other players otherwise I would have to wait until the world around me loaded in before I could move. I don’t think I got a single kill in the 10 or so games I played. 

Fast forward to 2021. I read there were some performance improvement so I’d thought I’d give it another shot. I’m getting stable 60 FPS and can actually see what’s going on. I really wasn’t expecting to even get more than 30 FPS, but wow I’m actually having fun now.

"How to bring players back in NA:

OPTION 1

Instead of adding a new map, highlight a single existing map for a month (with all play type options):  

- Erangel or All Maps random option
- Miramar or All Maps random option
- etc.

OPTION 2 (which I think is best)

Highlight a pair of maps:

- Erangel /Miramar or All Maps random option
- Erangel /Vikendi or All Maps random option
- etc.

Erangel will always be a map people are happy to play on, even if it is not their favorite. 

OPTION 3

- Permanent Erangel 24/7/365 - Erangel is always an option and you never change this
- All Maps random option

Reasoning:

Again, everyone would be satisfied with Erangel, even if it isn't their favorite map, because there are enough players that Erangel would always have human players.

If the counter argument is that would leave the other maps with fewer players, then that is, unfortunately, a problem that has been caused by PUBG and not the players. I would rather play Erangel every single match than play 4-5 teams with 80+ bots.","Erangel should just be its own queue. It'd be populated. It actually was the fastest queue by a long shot when Erangel was featured post rework.

\- Your Coupons should go towards teams that you believe will be TOP 4 in WEEKLY FINALS.  


So, based on this, you should not cast your Coupons until you see which teams are in FINALS.

It's amazing how well Erangel was designed out of the gates. All the subsequent maps are just trying to recapture that magic.,"If they were trying to replicate erangel then we wouldn't have garbage like haven, sancock, karakin and vikendi that required 30 remasters and it still is laughably bad compared to erangel and miramar.

Erangel was really fucking good which is why it was surprising that they made it better with the remaster considering that all of their maps up until that point were hot garbage(including miramar which needed a lot of QoL updates before it became playable and competitively good). Years have passed and we still have only 2 very good maps and every single one except paramo straying extremely far from Erangel and the core of PUBG. If PUBG 2 really is coming then they really need to step up their map design game, and they need to cut 90% of the garbage we are forced to play atm. The maps are soooooo bad. It's insane how the game has been on for 3+ years yet it only has 2 good maps and without map select you barely get to play them.

"Do not attempt to determine whether or not a player is cheating based on the replay. The reality is that there is no way be objectively sure that a player was cheating, with a few obvious exceptions like flying/underground vehicles or speedhacks, both of which I haven't seen since at least 2019. Cheaters are so much rarer now compared to a year+ ago and are actually \_more\_ prevalent in ranked, since in their view there is actually something to play for in ranked.

Look, I know this is the opposite of what you want to hear but the odds of you encountering this large of a string of cheaters in that small amount of time is *incredibly* small. The reality is you got outplayed and/or out-aimed. It's not something to be ashamed of; in fact it is to be expected since you said yourself you haven't played for a year. This should motivate you to practice and get your skills back up to scratch!

If you fall into the trap of being trigger-happy with the hackusations, you are doing yourself the worst disservice possible by effectively hard-capping your potential. Learning from your mistakes, analyze your losses and your victories, and applying those takeaways into your gameplay; this is the way to improve. I play with people almost daily on the Reddit discord, wanna know why the vast majority never exceed 250-300 season ADR?  **They are too proud to learn from their mistakes!** I beg you, don't be one of those people. Be better.

Edited since the formatting doesn't work with asterisks or underscores...","I played 3 games, one had a cheater confirmed by the game itself, he got banned while I was playing, I saw the red message appear, so already your claim falls short.

Anyhow I'm not letting that stop me from playing more, I tried to play today but server maintenance :(.

I've also watched some streamers PUBG play recently, like wackyjacky and he encounters quite a few cheaters as well, and he has way more hours in the game than myself. I remember a couple of weeks ago I tuned in to his stream, and literally 3 games in a row he reported his killers for cheating. And I don't blame him, he analyzed the footage and spectated them and it did really look like the dudes were cheating. He'd check their profile later, and you'd see godly KDR and win rates...

when you watch live on twitch the games arround about 12 mins in each game there will be a code given on the screen. you have to go inside pubg client (ingame) and at the store section on the bottom left you can redeem that code,This kinda sucks since I watch and catch up on the VODs due to timezones.

"Don't bother.


As others have said, a code appears on screen jsut before about circle 3 pop, entering it into the game client and you get...1k EP. 

Yup 1K EP, for a total of 80k EP. That means you have to race everybody else to enter the code, each game for 80 games. If that sounds like fun to you, more power to you. Tip, leave PUBG in window mode on the code entering screen so you can quickly type in the code when it appears. Doing this should basically guarantee you get the code every time. 

Also possible EP amount goes up with each week? I have no reason to think this but 1K EP drops is stupidly low so.","While I can agree it being low amount, you have to remember that correct picks in pick'em challenge are supposed to grant the majority of EP that's possible to get.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

"I stopped reading your post at "" 1.4 vert"".


Start at 0.85 and you'll see immediately a huge diference believe me.
Here is a guy that used for a long time 1.3 vert and felt same experience as you.

Good luck.",I was under the impression that a higher vert means you have to pull down less to control the vertical jumps. Wouldn't that make controlling those easier?,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"With a few notable exceptions, ALWAYS CROUCH WHEN SPRAYING! If you are holding mouse1, you are crouched. Simple as that. If you have truly “tried” every other suggestion here, this is literally the only possible reason why you still are bad at spraying.","I try to crouch. In situations where I can set up a spray it seems to help. But in quick action situations, especially TDM, I am usually dead too quick to get a crouch in.

For me the problem seems to be that first big vertical jump of the first two bullets. At distances of 50 or more meters it just jerks my reticle off the target and I have to pull down so hard to get it back on... by then I'm usually dead.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"dont play 1.4 vert, try 1.1 or 1","I heard (forget where, but I usually only take advice from trusted sources) that the higher vert is better for longer sprays, especially with 2x or 4x scope, etc.

Would you say it's not worth it?",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Higher vertical sensitivity is good for close quarters but it's probably worse for literally anything else. Do you win more in close combats?

Also, are you sure you are not mixing pre-aiming skills and reaction time with spray control? Perfect situation would be when you stand against each other and start shooting at the same moment but of course it never happens. In all other cases pre-aiming and reaction time is a huge deal no less important than spray control.

Edit: and how are your first bullets hitting? Are you good at hitting first bunch?","My initial aim is pretty good. The very first bullet is usually on target. But the next two, that initial big jump, always jerks me way off target and that is where I have trouble getting back on. This is mostly at range or when aiming for a small target, like a head sticking out over the top of a building or hill.

First bullet lands, then I am 5 feet over the person's head and playing the pull down the mouse game to get back on target. I try aggressively pulling the mouse down right as I fire that first bullet, but I end up with the opposite problem. Yanking my reticle under the target... then trying to compensate.

There is a clearly a sweet spot and a technique to those first few bullets that I just have not mastered.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"I had the same issue on 1.2 vert sens, i lowered my vert sens back down to 1 and I think it helped once I got used to it. Thinking of try 0.85 sens next, couple of the streamers I watch play on that and they say it makes their sprays less bouncy. Give it a go for a few weeks and see for yourself.","Waaaah? sens is all based on your personal preference, changing your shit to match someone elses preferences just fuck it up more.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"You have to have low enough sens to pull down consistently and control the side to side recoil without overcorrecting, but it has to be high enough to control the vertical. Your combo of 800 DPI with 1.4 vertical sens is for sure destroying your sprays. 

Try lowering your DPI to 400. Try Wacky Jackys trick of lowering it slowly over a couple weeks, 100 or 200 DPI at a time. The lower your DPI is the more accurate your mouse sensor is too.

If you want to go by the best pros and streamers, you never want to be higher than 25 sens at 800 DPI, 35 sens at 600, or 45 sens at 400 DPI. On the other hand you can go much lower than that. E.G. 400 DPI with 30 in game sens and 1.2 or 1.3 vertical is a pretty common combo for pro players. Which is like half what you play at. It sounds counter intuitive but it's actually much easier to control recoil at lower sens. I would try to get down to at least 600 DPI 1.2 Vertical with 30 in game, or 400 DPI 1.4 vertical 40 in game.

I personally played at 800 DPI for a while before switching to 400 and was almost instantly twice as good. I played at 400 DPI 45 in game 1.0 vertical for the longest time before recently changing to 400 DPI 42 in game 1.2 vertical and I again got much better. I have a 4 K/D and rarely lose a mid range 1v1 spray battle.

To spray a kitted Beryl or M4 with a 2x or 3x on it you should have to pull down from the top of your mouse pad all the way to the bottom to spray the whole mag. Your sens should be low enough that spraying a whole mag from a naked weapon should cause you to run out of mousepad space after like 20 bullets. Controlling recoil is all about making lot's of very small adjustments constantly at a consistent rate, overcorrecting recoil is just as bad as  not controlling it at all.

At the end of the day though you have to find what works for you, if you change something and feel like it helps go for it. But definitely try to stick with the same sens for a while and test it out in TDM before changing it again.",The DPIs and sens combinations you stated are neither accurate nor equivalent.,PUBATTLEGROUNDS

"Well...  

41.8% headshots... 

and that is just not with Snipers but normal Rifles..   that is why","How do you see those stats?

I doubt that I have 41,8% headshot rate with AR's, but even if I do, its probably something to do with the fact that my AR aim is bad, and I usually lose 1v1 duels on close range unless I get a headshot. So the stats might be a bit skewed from that. If there was a stat showing how many bullets out of a spray that actually landed, my stats would probably be pretty laughable.

My sniper headshot rate should probably be higher, as I have a ton of the headshot achievement, and well, kinda base my game around getting angles on people behind cover to 1-tap them.

And I'd guess 50-70% of my kills are sniper kills, so 41,8% headshot overall sounds very likely",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

"Your supposition is 100% wrong. There's a cheat out there that allows you to modify the game's files and deal higher damage to opponents. It's client-sided, so your enemies won't get the same ability. The AWM becomes one-shot because it's already strong, so with the damage hack it becomes a 1-hit cannon.(even non-headshots.)

P.S: It also increases the hitbox, so that might be why the server is registering ""none"".","Yeah that's what I think too.

The space between helmet and body is not vulnerable enough to oneshot people with AWM vs lvl 3 gear. 

So the hitboxes and damage are probably being tampered with. As if all his shots were headshots without being labelled as such.

Basically I was full hp so there is no way he could oneshot me without headshot.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Was your vest cracked? If it was either you can get 1 shot by an awm. It does enough damage. I think maybe even a level 1 is one shot as well.  Edit: just checked it 1 shots a level 1,"Nope full hp full level 3 gear.

Who can guarantee they have an hour free every day for the next 3 months. Without spending any BP for the Extra Missions you have to log on everyday making the past super deceptive as completing all the missions is not easy. If you do spend the extra BP for more missions it takes double the time and is no longer just the default pass. Did you even complete the pass the default way without buying boosts or extra missions? It is designed to be basically impossible the default way so it's forces you to have to spend extra money.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"Ten bucks for almost 70+ items is a fair deal in my opinion. If you play regularly and start early during the battle pass period you have almost no problem finishing all 100 levels. 

I would play pubg with or without BP, but getting constantly new skins while playing and supporting your favourite game developer is awesome.


It's probably a more general discussion: I played 1000h of pubg and maybe paid like 150€ in skin momey. 
I think for a game that catches me for this many hours that's a fair price.
Normal games have 20h playtime and cost 60-70€

What people have to understand that excellent games like pubg won't exist if developers can't make money of it. And compared to other hobbies playing videogames and buying skins/battle passes from to time is super cheap for you but developers desperatly need money for development/support purposes. (Exception is maybe valve milking the csgo skin market and not caring a bit about the actual game) Because creating a game is super expensive, but what is really expensive is nurturing a game after the initial release when the hype is gone, player numbers go down. Having a support/development team/server structure constantly on payroll.","Do you honestly believe the pass wasn't designed to be as tedious as possible to force you to buy the boost? It would be fine if they made the pass more expensive, but the deception is disgusting where they disguise the pass as only $10 with easy missions only to find out doing the three missions a day doesn't even get you one level and the weekly missions only give 3 levels. As there are 100 levels it is just under a minimum of 100 days of constantly logging on to complete pass in its default for. That is a whole bloody quarter of a year. So it's not $10 it's $10 plus an hour of your day for a quarter of a fucking year. So that's 100 fucking hours to complete the default pass. It's disgusting and deceptive to design a pass to look cheap but so time-consuming that you have to pay to complete it. Devs don't be deceptive, remove the pass boosts and just increase the cost of the pass. Get rid of the XP as a level reward as that only serves your purpose of making it ultra time-consuming and give more XP for the daily and weekly missions.

Devs if you want PUBG to make more money I've made a post on that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/kxrfvc/how\_to\_address\_the\_cosmetics\_trade\_conundrum\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/kxrfvc/how_to_address_the_cosmetics_trade_conundrum_in/)",PUBATTLEGROUNDS

"This has been asked for years, a few responses were made, you won't get offline mode, because they would need to give much more acces to the core of the game to you (and cheat makers as well) that currently runs server side and is not accessible.

Running both the server and bots on your local machine is kind of a nope thing to do, 90% of the rigs  have trouble running the game, how do you think your PC will run the game + host the game + host the bots? Now you might have a 5k+ rig that could potentially do it, but it's not worth doing all the development and exposing even more code to abusers just so less then 1% of people use that mode like 20 times...

A side reason (not stated by pubg) of not doing that is the fact that you will loose a part of the fun/intrest in the game. No matter how you feel, but sucking and getting better at the game is part of the experience. Think about how ""peak"" for most games was in the ""good old days"", why is that? Because every game was good? Nope because everyone was bad, everyone had goals, and grinded to get good. The pleasure of being really good doesn't last very long, but the pleasure of getting better does. That's how our minds work, we want goals, we want to reach those goals (that's the reason you made this post) because our brain will reward us when we improve, but the harder you work, the better the results feel (that's one of the reasons why pubg feels so appealing, it's fking hard, and that's the reason winning games feels so god damn good).","Do you even know how much CPU power a bot uses? Do you even know that the whole game is already locally run and it's just the people that are loaded from the server? Since I've suggested the number of bots being configurable you can set it to what your computer can handle. Lastly do you even know how cheated are developed? You know they can already run a custom server with them and their friends to test their hacks. Do you even know anything about how ants cheats work?

"I wouldn't call it ""no vehicle damage"" if it started smoking","True. Although it sounds like their point was it’s weird they got the kills without destroying the BRDM.

"Just as much RNG as any other FPS or BR game, you can land safe and basically avoid all hot drop RNG but most ppl in normal matches aren't too worried about it, so your statement of ""the first 5 mins of a match is rng"" is very true if you choose to hot drop.","Yea... I found RNG and ""luck"" to be less of an issue when I didn't hot drop. Still can be (eg not finding helm/bag/vest) but the chances of death as a result are much less.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
"not really! It's only luck if you rely on something happening or on your own assumptions. Because then you can call it unlucky if something else happened or your assumptions didn´t come true.

It' can be a very tactical game if you play it that way. Most experienced players however just rng what they know worked in the past and either hide in buildings till they have to go or just try to overpower enemies. And if they lose, they accuse bad luck as the perfect culprit.","Good summary. There are certain “unlucky” moments for anyone, but playing well and using tactics will minimize the impact of luck against you. I tend to look at good information/intel and good positioning as the counters to bad luck. 

There are also some situations where you have to understand what’s a likely outcome and try to use the RNG or luck to your advantage. E.g. if you’re in a 1v2 or 1v3 against decent players, or you’re in a really bad position, there might be a low chance of winning if you play a straight up gunfight and minimize your risks in each moment, but you can sometimes take some individual risks which increase the chance of failure in the moment, but are really the only chance you have to come out alive in the end.",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
Mobile has no good exclusive content. Console/pc version is much better,"There is some amount of good exclusive content on mobile, a private training mode with bots for example, although yes not much",PUBATTLEGROUNDS
