      "I got a B&W laser printer for £30, with working cartridge still in. Just scouted ebay for collection only laser printers (quite a few due to the weight), found one not much larger than inkjet printers, and offered to pay for for the courier if they packed it, which they were happy to do.\n",

      "We had an old HP color inkjet for like 16 years at work, and we finally replaced it with a newer HP inkjet, and after a couple of days the guy who had to use it the most literally went out and looked through the dumpster in case the old one was still there.  The quality and usability now is like 10%, and we went through three of the things in the first few months before we got one that wouldn't just stop working completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought an HP LaserJet 4 for work in 1992 for like two grand, and that obviously wasn't cheap -- but my brother is *still using it* for work.  It prints every day.  I don't know how much we've spent on toner, but it's less than we would've spent on inkjet ink in a couple of years, for sure.\n",
      "And if you've got money, get a coloured laser. They're even more expensive but give coloured prints with the reliability of a B/W laser\n",
      "Only drawback is that they use tons of power compared to inkjets. I gotta rev up the generator everytime I gotta print a big document\n",
      "What if I told you, there is no white ink. Monochrome\n",

I did finally get it working again after we bought a new one. Turned out one of their updates switched the VoIP settings. You'd think HP would be aware of this and share this insight....

      "I kept toying with the idea, but never did because I couldn't really justify the cost since I don't print that much so would just buy whatever $40 xmas sale model I could each year. Once I finally got to the point where I could easily afford one, I had pretty much stopped printing. At this point, I don't even print 3 pages a year so any amount is too much. Don't even really need a printer.\n",
      "... or of you print a lot of pages. Or if your need your prints quick.  Laser printers are superior in every way except cost.\n",
      "Recently bought myself a simple black and white laser printer by Brother. It has been such a breath of fresh air. Not very expensive. Spits pages out quickly, does front and back printing, and one cartridge will print far more pages than my ink printer\n",
      "Yes! I got a Brother laser printer a few years ago and I love it! It was like $300. I'll never go back to inkjet.\n",
      "Yep, I switched to mutli function colour lasers. Yes they're expensive but they're so much better in every way. Need to print loads - they're better. Need to print once in six months, great your toner is right where you left it.\n",

      "There definitely less reliable than old B and W lasers though. Some of those are absolute workhorses but I do value the extra functionality\n",

      "When I was in college, my friends and I discovered it was cheaper to buy a new cheap (~$20) printer at Walmart than to purchase replacement ink (~$30).  So when our printer ran out of ink, we just bought a new printer.\n",
      "Did they stop making printers with the ability to do this?  I haven't owned a printer in 10+ years but I remember printing out pictures for school even when a certain cartridge would be empty.  It would just print out faded and usually pink for some reason.\n",
      "My printer forgot how to print a lowercase l.  It was fun printing an assignment and then checking it quick to see blanks where the letter should be.\n",
      "I worked as a visiting repairman for laser printers. As a fun trivia, my colleague told me how to can print a color image on a monochrome printer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to do this, you have to edit a picture in a certain way. Leave only one of four major colours. Use a color cartridge. Print. Repeat four times.\n",

      "damn even paper isn’t safe wtf\n",
      "So that explains why they won’t let you print without a color, even if the page isn’t using the color, it’s needed for encoding. It’s still infuriating, but I can kind of understand the reason atleast.\n",

      "Ayyy. I got a HP printer second hand and it works fine but the person that owned it before me modded the firmware on it by changing the serial number in the firmware instead of just through the service menu. Now it can't get software updates (which was the initial reason for them modding the serial even though HP backtracked on their cartridge policy). I didn't even know you could do that to printers but it goes to show what people will go through to combat HP's bullshit.\n",
